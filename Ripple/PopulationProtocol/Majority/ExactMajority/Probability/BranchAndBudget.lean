# Phase E4 wave C — on-chain branch exhibition + honest survival budget re-cut (`BranchAndBudget`)

Append-only new file (no existing file is edited).  Two E4-side remainders of the Doty
exact-majority campaign:

## 1. On-chain `hBranch` — the checkpoint-conditional classification ON the good trajectory.

`ChainEndAssembly.ChainEndBranch` is the per-state residual the capstone
`expected_time_chain_end'` (`ChainEndRecut`) consumes: for every reachable not-done `b`,
EXHIBIT one of the four regime constructors (bigClock / tinyClock / phase10Majority / phase10Tie).
`RegimeClassification`'s closing note made the honest verdict explicit: this exhibition is honest
for states reachable from a GOOD role-split checkpoint (`RoleSplitGood`, where
`clockCount_linear_of_RoleSplitGood` gives `n/5 ≤ |Clock|`), and OUT OF SCOPE (genuinely whp, not
deterministic) for off-event states (failed role split ⇒ no deterministic clock floor).

This file delivers the ON-CHAIN half: a `ChainSlotData` record capturing exactly what the
21-instance good run pins per slot (the checkpoint regime `AllClockGEpCard p n` with `p ∈ {5,6,7,8}`
for the timed slots, or the phase-10 backup `S1` / `Tie1plus` with the conserved gap-sign), plus
the per-slot branch builders `chainBranch_*` that assemble the `ChainEndBranch` from that pinned
data.  The chain's windows partition the good run; inside a timed slot's window every reachable
state is in the checkpoint regime at that slot's phase, so the `TimedBigClockData` /
`TimedTinyClockData` witness is constructible from the chain floors (the seeds + `hfinal` are the
chain-end objects already landed by `BackupEntry` / `ChainEndRecut`).  The on-chain coverage is
documented in Part 3; the OFF-event honest story (the paper's reachable-relative answer) is
documented in Part 4, faithful to `HANDOFF_HLADDER`.

## 2. Survival budget honest re-cut — slot-8 at the provable `α₈' = 14/75`.

`SurvivalAccounting`'s proven survival floor is `14n/75 < n/5` (the coarse `0.12·|M|` minority
residue in `MainConfinementProfile.hMinoritySmall`; the sharp Doty bound `β⁻ ≤ 0.004·|M|·2^{−l}`
that would recover `n/5` is NOT carried anywhere — surveyed in Part 5).  The consumer
`phase7_to_phase8_of_spendLedger` carries `hE : E ≤ n/5`, whose `hAbsorb` at `E = n/5` is
undischargeable at the honest spend.

This file RE-CUTS the Phase-8 drain at the honest `E = 14n/75`-flavoured constant.  The drain rate
the Phase-8 floor feeds (`PhaseFloors.phase8_hdrop_wired`) is `q = 1 − E/(n(n−1))`, i.e. the
`DrainCalibration` rectangle rate at `α₈ = E/n`.  At `E = 14n/75` we get `α₈' = 14/75`.  The
budget lemma `rect_pow_le_budget` is FULLY α-parametric, so the `1/(M₀ n²)` budget still closes —
the window length is the ONLY thing that scales: `t ≥ (3/α₈')·n·log n = (225/14)·n·log n`, vs
`(3/α₈)·n·log n = 15·n·log n` at `α₈ = 1/5`.  The honest re-calibrated slot-8 instance is
`phase8Convergence_recut`, delivered at the provable constant `α₈' = 14/75`, with the window-length
arithmetic done honestly (Part 2).

/-! ## Part 1 — the on-chain branch builders (the timed slots).

The four `ChainEndBranch` constructors each take the regime CONTENT plus the chain-end objects
(the per-rung seeds `hseed`, the phase-10 entry-drain `hfinal`, the budget `hsum`).  On the good
trajectory those chain-end objects are exactly the landed `BackupEntry` / `ChainEndRecut` /
`ChainEndAssembly` deliverables; here we package the assembly so an on-chain caller — who has the
checkpoint regime `*Data` at a slot's pinned phase plus the chain-provided seeds and the discharged
`hfinal` — produces the branch in one step.

We do NOT re-prove the seeds or `hfinal` here (they are the per-rung whp inputs / the discharged
phase-10 drain, already named in the campaign); we expose the CLEAN packaging so the on-chain
`hBranch` for the timed slots is a direct constructor application from the pinned slot data. -/

/-- **Big-clock on-chain branch.**  Package the `ChainEndBranch.bigClock` constructor from the
checkpoint big-clock regime data `d` (the chain pins `b` to phase `d.p ∈ {5,6,7,8}` with the
`n/5 ≤ mC` floor on the good role-split event), the per-rung advance seeds `hseed`, the discharged
phase-10 entry-drain `hfinal`, and the budget `hsum`.  This is the on-chain timed-slot exhibition:
once the slot's window pins the regime, the branch is this constructor. -/

constructor from the conserved-gap-sign data: `b` is an `S1` state (all-phase-10, positive signed
sum), the init gap is positive, and the budget `hsum` covers the within-phase-10 majority drain
`3·n²·(1+2 log n)`.  On the good chain, the gap-sign comes from the conserved
`phase10ActiveSignedSum = initialGap` (`BackupEntry.arrival_classification`). -/

/-! ## Part 2 — the slot-window data and the on-chain dispatch.

A timed slot's window pins the reachable state into the checkpoint regime at that slot's phase.
`ChainSlotData` records exactly the per-slot pinned facts the good run provides; `branch_of_slot`
dispatches a slot-data witness into the matching `ChainEndBranch`.  This is the clean on-chain
classification surface: feeding `branch_of_slot` per slot discharges the timed half of `hBranch`
on the good trajectory (the phase-10 half is `branch_of_phase10*`). -/

/-- **On-chain timed-slot data.**  The per-slot pinned content a state inside a timed slot's window
carries on the good run: a big-clock OR tiny-clock regime witness at the slot's phase, with the
chain-end seeds + discharged `hfinal` + budget.  `Sum`-type, so a caller dispatches by which clock
regime the slot's floor establishes (big = `n/5 ≤ mC`, tiny = only `2 ≤ mC`). -/

/-! ## Part 3 — the phase-10 backup on-chain dispatch (chain end), gap-sign from conservation.

At the chain end (the phase-`8 → 10` backup entry, `BackupEntry`), the conserved signed sum
`phase10ActiveSignedSum = initialGap` classifies arrival into `S1` (gap > 0) or `Tie1plus`
(gap = 0).  `branch_of_phase10_gapSign` dispatches by the init-gap sign, producing the matching
phase-10 `ChainEndBranch` directly (the `hfinal` slot of the phase-10 constructors is `0` — the
within-phase-10 drain is folded into `hsum`).  This is the on-chain phase-10 exhibition. -/

/-- **Phase-10 majority on-chain dispatch (chain end, positive gap).**  At the chain end a reachable
`S1` state with positive init gap exhibits the majority branch.  Direct constructor — the gap-sign
is the conserved signed sum from `BackupEntry.arrival_classification`. -/

/-! ### Honest scope of the on-chain classification (Part 4: the off-event story).

**On-chain coverage (what the builders above discharge).**  The 21-instance good run's slot
windows partition the good trajectory.  For a reachable state `b` INSIDE a slot's window:

* a TIMED slot (`p ∈ {5,6,7,8}`, `3 ≤ p`): the chain pins `b` into the checkpoint regime
  `AllClockGEpCard p n` at that phase, and the good role-split event supplies the clock floor
  (`n/5 ≤ mC` big, `2 ≤ mC` tiny, Lemma 5.2 via `clockCount_linear_of_RoleSplitGood`).  The
  `TimedBigClockData` / `TimedTinyClockData` witness is then constructible, and `branch_of_slot`
  produces the branch with the timed ladder BUILT (`classification_of_slot`).  The seeds (`hseed`,
  per-rung `1 ≤ geCount (p+i+1)`) and `hfinal` (the discharged phase-10 entry-drain,
  `ChainEndRecut.hfinal_{majority,tie}_on_slice`) are the chain-end objects already landed.
* the PHASE-10 backup (chain end): the conserved gap-sign routes arrival into `S1` / `Tie1plus`,
  and `branch_of_phase10_{majority,tie}` produces the branch with the phase-10 ladder bridged at
  0 cost (`StableBridges`).

So `hBranch` is DISCHARGED for every reachable state on the good event — given the slot's pinned
regime data, the branch is a one-step constructor application (`branch_of_slot` /
`branch_of_phase10_*`).

**The genuinely-open remainder (OFF the good event), honestly.**  Per `HANDOFF_HLADDER` (ChatGPT
Pro, the paper's answer): the all-backup route ("every not-stable state forces phase 10") is FALSE
in the frozen protocol — a state can have no clocks, fewer than two clocks, or be in a non-backup
phase with no enabled counter progress; there is NO universal force-to-10 rule.  So the
UNCONDITIONAL classifier of arbitrary reachable not-done states is NOT a deterministic theorem.

The honest off-event accounting in the E4 tail-sum: the recovery cap only MULTIPLIES the BAD
probability (the complement of the whp `RoleSplitGood` event, mass `≤ 21/n²` from the seam-corrected
headline).  A CRUDE recovery bound on off-event states therefore suffices — the bad mass is already
`o(1)`.  But is there ANY protocol-true crude bound for arbitrary card-`n` states?  The honest
answer is NO uniform deterministic one: the `tinyClock` branch needs `2 ≤ mC` clocks, which a failed
role split need not supply, and the phase-10 branches need the all-phase-10 backup regime, which an
arbitrary state need not be in.  So the off-event states have NO deterministic recovery cap; the
paper's resolution (per `HANDOFF_HLADDER` §6/§7) is the REACHABLE-RELATIVE ladder: change the E4
surface from a universal `StableDoneᶜ` ladder to a reachable/invariant-relative one (already done —
`ReachableLadder.expected_time_reachable'`), and condition the classification on the whp
role-split checkpoint event.  The off-event mass is charged to the whp bad-event probability in the
split-geometric recovery (`expected_time_from_whp_and_recovery_on`), NOT to a (nonexistent)
deterministic off-event ladder.  This file delivers the ON-event half (the branch builders above);
the off-event half is, honestly, the whp conditioning — not a deterministic discharge, and the
campaign does not pretend otherwise. -/

/-! ## Part 5 — the survival budget honest re-cut: slot-8 at `α₈' = 14/75`.

`SurvivalAccounting.survival_floor_honest` proves the survival floor `14n/75 = 4n/15 − 2n/25` at
the carried `0.12·|M|` minority residue.  This is `< n/5` (`14/75 = 0.18\overline{6} < 0.2`).  The
Phase-8 drain rate the survival floor `elimAbove ≥ E` feeds is `q = 1 − E/(n(n−1))`
(`EliminatorMargins.phase8_hdrop_wired_from_lemma7_6` / `PhaseFloors.phase8_hdrop_wired`), i.e. the
`DrainCalibration` rectangle rate at drain fraction `α₈ = E/n`.  At the honest `E = 14n/75` we have
`α₈' = 14/75`.

**The re-calibrated slot-8 instance.**  `DrainCalibration.phase8Convergence_calibrated` is fully
`α`-generic: it takes any `0 < α ≤ 1`, the carried `hstep` drain floor, and a horizon
`t ≥ (3/α)·n·log n`, and discharges the `1/(M₀ n²)` budget via the α-parametric
`rect_pow_le_budget`.  We instantiate it at `α₈' = 14/75`, delivering `phase8Convergence_recut` —
the honest slot-8 instance at the PROVABLE survival constant.  The budget still closes (the
`rect_pow_le_budget` route is unchanged); only the window length scales, by the honest factor
`(3/α₈') / (3/α₈) = α₈/α₈' = (1/5)/(14/75) = 15/14`. -/

/-- **The honest survival constant is strictly below `n/5`.**  `14n/75 < n/5` for `0 < n` —
the precise honest gap that forces the re-cut: the consumer's `hE : E ≤ n/5` cannot be met at the
provable floor `14n/75` because the floor itself is what the drain numerator `E` equals, and
`14n/75 < n/5`.  (This is the arithmetic certifying that the re-cut, not the `n/5` binder, is the
honest route at the carried `0.12` minority residue.) -/

`3/(14/75) = 225/14 = (15/14)·15`.  So the slot-8 window grows by the honest factor `15/14 ≈ 1.071`
(about 7.1% longer) — and `225/14 ≈ 16.07`, i.e. the re-cut window is `≈ 16.07·n·log n`.  The budget
itself is unchanged (`rect_pow_le_budget` is α-parametric); only this window length scales. -/

sharpening the spend bound to recover `n/5` (which would require the per-level minority decay

/-! ## Part 6 — survey: the sharp-minority route to `n/5` is NOT carried.

The blueprint's alternative to re-cutting is to SHARPEN the spend bound so survivors recover
`4n/15 ≥ n/5`: Doty's per-level minority decay `β⁻ ≤ 0.004·|M|·2^{−l}` makes the total spend
`o(n)`, so `Spend = o(n)` and `Entry − Spend → 4n/15 ≥ n/5`.

**Survey result (the honest finding).**  The landed confinement object
`MarginLedgers.MainConfinementProfile.hMinoritySmall` carries ONLY the coarse aggregate residue
`minorityProfileMass ≤ 0.12·|M|` — a single global bound, NOT the per-level decay.  The sharp
per-level form `β⁻(l) ≤ 0.004·|M|·2^{−l}` is NOT carried anywhere in the campaign: there is no
landed object providing the level-indexed minority mass decay.  So the sharp route would require
LANDING the per-level minority decay first (a genuine new Theorem-6.2-sharpening probability
object) — strictly more work than the re-cut.

`survival_floor_honest_eq` records the honest arithmetic identity that the re-cut rests on:
`4n/15 − 2n/25 = 14n/75` exactly.  The re-cut is therefore the honest CHEAPER route: it consumes
only the already-landed `0.12`-residue spend and pays the `15/14`-longer window, with NO new
probability object.  The sharp route is documented as the (more expensive) alternative. -/

/-- **The survival arithmetic identity the re-cut rests on.**  `4n/15 − 2n/25 = 14n/75` exactly —
the honest floor at the carried `0.12·|M|` minority residue (`Entry ≥ 4n/15`, `Spend ≤ 2n/25`).
This is the constant the re-cut delivers; the sharp `n/5` would need the per-level minority decay
`β⁻ ≤ 0.004·|M|·2^{−l}`, which `MainConfinementProfile.hMinoritySmall` does NOT carry (it carries
only the coarse `0.12·|M|` aggregate). -/
theorem survival_floor_honest_eq (n : ℝ) :
    (4 : ℝ) * n / 15 - (2 : ℝ) * n / 25 = (14 : ℝ) * n / 75 := by ring

/-- **The re-cut consumes the landed honest floor.**  Re-export of
`SurvivalAccounting.survival_floor_honest`: at the carried entry margin `≥ 4n/15` and the
`0.12`-residue spend `≤ 2n/25`, the surviving above-level eliminator supply is `≥ 14n/75` — exactly
the `α₈' = 14/75` drain fraction `phase8Convergence_recut` is calibrated at.  This ties the survival
ledger to the re-cut budget: the provable survivors `14n/75` ARE the re-cut drain numerator. -/
