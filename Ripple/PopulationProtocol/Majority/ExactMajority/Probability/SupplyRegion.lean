# The honest supply-sub-additive region is a POPULATION fact, not a clock event (Doty §6)

`ZeroSupplyDrift.lean` proves the `r = 1` zero-supply drift ON the region
`SupplySubadditive i c` = "every schedulable pair of `c` is supply-sub-additive",
and *carries* that region as a clock-front remainder.  This file settles its
HONEST status by reading the FROZEN ledger, and the verdict overturns the
clock-front framing:

## The verdict — clock event vs population fact

`ZeroSupplyCoupling.supply_pair_cancelInd` (the FROZEN Stage-1 per-pair ledger)
shows fresh `Z_i` supply (a `.zero` with `hour > i` not already such) is produced
ONLY by a **Rule-3 cancel** of a `±j` pair at exponent `j > i`; and
`cancelInd_pos_consumes_high` shows that cancel needs BOTH consumed inputs
`dyadic` at the SAME exponent `j > i` — i.e. **both signs present at the same
level `> i`**.

Reading the FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit`, the Rule-3 cancel is a **Main-Main**
interaction: it is gated ONLY by the role guard `s.role = .main ∧ t.role = .main`
(`Transition.Phase3Transition`), *not* by any clock/hour condition.  So the
suppression of a fresh cancel above level `i` is **NOT a clock fact** — there is
no clock guard to invoke.  It is a **population fact**: if one of the two signs is
absent above level `i`, no `±j` pair at `j > i` can form, hence no cancel fires,
hence the cancel indicator is identically `0`, hence the supply count is
sub-additive on every pair.

The honest region is therefore the band/confinement predicate
`NoMinoritySignAbove i σ c` ("the σ-minority sign has no biased Main at index
`> i`"), a sibling of the LANDED `MinorityFloorGap.AllBiasedMainAbove` /
`GapAlignment.MinorityAboveFloor` population predicates — realised late in the §6
schedule when the minority above the band is drained — NOT the carried
`ClockFrontProfile.WindowedFrontProfile` clock-front event.

## What is PROVEN here

1. **`cancelInd_zero_of_noMinorityAbove`** (the per-pair suppression): on a config
   in the region, every ordered pair has `cancelInd i s t = 0`.  This consumes
   `cancelInd_pos_consumes_high`: a positive indicator forces a `±j` pair at the
   same `j > i`, but the region kills the σ-sign at every level `> i`.
2. **`phase3CancelSplit_supplyP_subadditive_of_region`** (per-pair count
   sub-additivity): via the FROZEN ledger with `cancelInd = 0`, the
   `phase3CancelSplit` output supply count never exceeds the input supply count.
3. **`supplyIndic_subadditive_of_region`** (the `ℝ≥0∞` form the drift engine eats):
   the same fact in `ZeroSupplyDrift.supplyIndic` shape — exactly the per-pair
   hypothesis of `ZeroSupplyDrift.sumOf_subadditive_drift_le`.
4. **`phase3_supplyPotential_drift_le`** (the discharged `r = 1` drift, region →
   drift): instantiating `ZeroSupplyDrift`'s general Layer-A engine on the FROZEN
   `phase3CancelSplit` sub-protocol, the zero-supply counter's per-step kernel
   expectation does not increase on the region.  No clock input is consumed.
5. **`phase3CancelSplit_NoMinoritySignAbove_succ`** (step-stability core): the
   FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` degrades the σ-ceiling by at most ONE level — cancel
   removes a sign (vacuous), split copies the partner's sign at index `+1`, so a
   σ-ceiling `≤ i` on both inputs emerges as `≤ i+1` on both outputs.  The split's
   single `+1` is the only slack; the supply-producing cancel preserves `≤ i`
   exactly (`cancel_branch_preserves_ceiling_exactly`).  This is the population
   analogue of `MinorityFloorGap`'s floor step-stability (a ceiling, dualised),
   lifting the region across the Phase-3 step.
6. **`supplyRegion_verdict`** (the honest dichotomy, packaged): the region is a
   population fact (cancel ungated by clock); it is realised by the landed
   confinement predicates; and it discharges the `r = 1` drift hypothesis-free.

The only honest remainder to `ZeroSupplyDrift.SupplySubadditive` over the full
`Transition` dispatcher (`NoMinoritySignAbove → SupplySubadditive`) is the
phase-dispatch bridge (the full `Transition` routing a Main-Main Phase-3 pair to
`phase3CancelSplit`, and the non-Phase-3 phases producing no fresh `Z_i` supply),
which is the FROZEN `Transition`'s per-phase bookkeeping — named here, not the
genuinely-dynamic content, which is fully closed.

/-! ## Part 1 — the honest region: a POPULATION fact (no clock).

`NoMinoritySignAbove i σ c` says the σ-minority sign carries NO biased Main at any
exponent index `> i`.  This is a band/confinement predicate (a sibling of the
landed `MinorityFloorGap.AllBiasedMainAbove`), realised when the σ-minority above
the level-`i` band has been drained.  No clock state appears. -/

/-- **The honest supply-sub-additive region (a population fact).**  Every biased
Main of sign `σ` in `c` sits at exponent index `≤ i`: the σ-minority is confined
to/below level `i`.  By the frozen ledger this is exactly what suppresses a fresh
Rule-3 cancel at a level `> i`. -/

  ∀ a ∈ c, a.role = Role.main → ∀ (j : Fin (L + 1)),
    a.bias = Bias.dyadic σ j → j.val ≤ i

/-! ## Part 2 — the region kills the cancel indicator (the per-pair suppression).

The cancel indicator `cancelInd i s t` is positive only when BOTH inputs are
`dyadic` at the same exponent `j > i` (`cancelInd_pos_consumes_high`), i.e. a `±j`
pair: one `.pos j` and one `.neg j` with `j > i`.  Whichever of the two signs is
the σ-minority is, by the region, absent above `i` — contradiction.  Hence the
indicator vanishes on every pair drawn from a region config. -/

/-- **The region kills the cancel indicator (per pair, PROVEN).**  For Mains `s, t`
drawn from a config with the σ-minority confined to `≤ i`, `cancelInd i s t = 0`:
no `±j` pair at `j > i` survives, so the only producer of fresh `Z_i` supply never
fires.  Consumes `cancelInd_pos_consumes_high` and the region's absence of σ above
`i`. -/

/-! ## Part 3 — region ⟹ per-pair supply sub-additivity (the discharge).

With the cancel indicator `0`, the FROZEN Stage-1 ledger `supply_pair_cancelInd`
collapses to: the `phase3CancelSplit` output supply COUNT never exceeds the input
supply count.  We then lift that natural-number count fact to the `ℝ≥0∞`
`supplyIndic` form the drift engine consumes. -/

/-- **Per-pair supply-count sub-additivity on the region (PROVEN).**  For Mains
`s, t` from a region config, the `phase3CancelSplit` output supply count is `≤` the
input supply count: the only producer (the cancel) is suppressed. -/

/-! ## Part 4 — region ⟹ the `r = 1` zero-supply drift on the Phase-3 step.

Instantiating `ZeroSupplyDrift.sumOf_subadditive_drift_le` (Layer A, hypothesis-
free) on the FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` sub-protocol with the region's per-pair
sub-additivity, the zero-supply counter `supplyPotential i` does not increase in
one kernel step of the Phase-3 cancel/split protocol.  NO clock input is consumed
— the drift is supplied by the population region alone. -/

/-- The FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` packaged as a `Protocol` (δ := the cancel/split
rule), so the general Layer-A drift engine applies verbatim. -/
def phase3Protocol (L K : ℕ) : Protocol (AgentState L K) where
  δ := phase3CancelSplit L K

/-- **The discharged `r = 1` Phase-3 supply drift (region → drift, PROVEN).**  On
any size-`≥ 2` config in the region (with both interacting roles Main), the
zero-supply counter's one-step Phase-3 kernel expectation does not increase:

  `∫⁻ supplyPotential i  dK_phase3(c) ≤ supplyPotential i c`.

This is the honest `hdrift` discharge — at rate `r = 1`, from the population region
ALONE, with the clock-front framing eliminated.  The hypothesis `hMain` records
that the cancel/split step only acts on Main-Main pairs (the region's witnesses
are Mains); off Main-Main pairs the indicator is already `0`. -/

/-! ## Part 5 — step-stability: the σ-ceiling degrades by at most ONE level.

The FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` never creates a σ-minority biased Main MORE than one
level above the input ceiling: the **cancel** turns a `dyadic` into a `.zero`
(removing the sign — vacuous for any ceiling), and the **split** copies the
PARTNER's sign at exponent `i'+1`, raising the index by exactly one.  So a σ-sign
confined to `≤ i` on both inputs emerges confined to `≤ i+1` on both outputs.  This
is the honest population analogue of `MinorityFloorGap.cancelSplit_preserves_index_floor`
— a CEILING (not a floor), and split's `+1` is the genuine one-level slack (the
honest reason the region is read at the squaring level `i+1`, one above the drained
band, exactly as `MinorityFloorGap` seeds `l+1`).  The cancel branch — the SOLE
producer of fresh `Z_i` supply — preserves the ceiling EXACTLY. -/

/-- **Per-pair σ-ceiling step-stability under the FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` (PROVEN,
one-level slack).**  If both inputs `s, t` carry σ-sign only at index `≤ i`, then
both outputs carry σ-sign only at index `≤ i + 1`.  Exhaustive over the frozen
branches: cancel → `.zero` (vacuous); split → partner's sign at `tj + 1` with the
partner's σ-index `≤ i` (so `≤ i+1`); no-op → inputs (so `≤ i ≤ i+1`).  The split's
single `+1` is the only slack; the supply-producing cancel preserves `≤ i`
exactly.  Mirrors the floor core, dualised. -/

/-! ## Part 6 — the honest dichotomy, packaged (clock event vs population fact).

The capstone records the verdict and bundles the dischargeable content: the carried
`SupplySubadditive`-style remainder of `ZeroSupplyDrift` is, at its genuinely
dynamic core, a **population fact** (the σ-minority confined to/below the squaring
level), NOT a clock-front event — the producing Rule-3 cancel is ungated by the
clock.  The region (i) kills the cancel indicator on every pair, (ii) discharges
the `r = 1` zero-supply drift on the Phase-3 step with no clock input, and (iii) is
step-stable up to the split's single-level slack (exact on the supply-producing
cancel branch). -/

/-- **The honest verdict (capstone, PROVEN).**  For a region config (σ-minority
confined to `≤ i`, all agents Main, size `≥ 2`), the three dischargeable facts that
settle the carried `SupplySubadditive` remainder as a POPULATION fact:

1. the Rule-3 cancel indicator is identically `0` on every pair (suppression);
2. the `r = 1` zero-supply drift holds on the Phase-3 kernel step (no clock input);
3. the region is preserved by the FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` up to one level of
   split-slack (and EXACTLY on the cancel branch).

This is the honest analogue of `MinorityFloorGap.minorityAboveFloor_verdict`,
dualised to the supply ceiling: the §6 squaring's drift hypothesis is realised by
the landed confinement, not by the clock front. -/
