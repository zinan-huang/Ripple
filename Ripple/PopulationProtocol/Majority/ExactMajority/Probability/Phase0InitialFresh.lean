# `Phase0InitialFresh` — the strengthened Phase-0 initializer (C0 fix).

Companion to `RoleSplitPhase0Counterexample.lean` (the verified `¬`-theorem showing the *weak*
`Phase0Initial` is too weak — it omits `assigned = false`, so the unconditional role-split bound is
provably false).  This file lands the **fix** the user chose ("strengthen"): a strengthened
initializer that adds the per-agent freshness flag, the bridge proving the **real** protocol start
(`validInitial`) satisfies it, and the payoff — the previously hand-*carried* `NoAssignedMcrConfig`
side-condition is now **derivable** from the start hypothesis.

Three load-bearing facts:

* `Phase0InitialFresh n c := Phase0Initial n c ∧ ∀ a ∈ c, a.assigned = false`, with the forgetful
  projection `Phase0InitialFresh.toPhase0Initial` (so every one of the ~40 lemmas consuming the weak
  `Phase0Initial` still fires unchanged from the strengthened start — no re-proof of the frozen
  interface, exactly as `TopSplitInward.lean:638` intended).
* `phase0InitialFresh_of_validInitial` — `validInitial c₀ ∧ c₀.card = n ⟹ Phase0InitialFresh n c₀`.
  This is the load-bearing soundness fact: the genuine Doty start (MainTheorem `validInitial`, which
  pins `assigned = false`) satisfies the strengthened initializer, so the corrected unconditional
  C0 bound is TRUE at the real start.  Extends the existing lossy bridge
  `FaithfulDischargeTierA.phase0Initial_of_validInitial` (which discarded freshness — the documented
  defect) into a freshness-preserving one.
* `noAssignedMcrConfig_of_phase0InitialFresh` — the **payoff**: `NoAssignedMcrConfig` (carried as an
  explicit hypothesis throughout `TopSplitInward` / `KilledTailConsumers` *because* it does not follow
  from the weak `Phase0Initial`) is now a one-line consequence of the strengthened start.  This is the
  concrete demonstration that the strengthening does its job.

/-- The **strengthened** Phase-0 initializer: the weak `Phase0Initial` (population size `n`, every
agent at phase `0`, role `mcr`) PLUS the per-agent freshness flag `assigned = false` that the
one-sided absorption Rules 2/3 (`Transition.lean`) require to clear a lone remaining `mcr`.  The weak
initializer omits this conjunct, which is exactly why the unconditional role-split tail bound is
refutable over it (`RoleSplitPhase0Counterexample.poisonedCfg3_never_good`). -/
