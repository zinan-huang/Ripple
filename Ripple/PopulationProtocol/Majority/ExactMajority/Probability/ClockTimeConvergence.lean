# The Phase-3 drip+epidemic minute clock — timing analysis (Avenue B keystone)

This file is **Avenue B** of the Doty et al. Theorem 3.1 time-half campaign
(see `DOTY_TIME_SCOPING.md` §4).  It formalizes the Phase-3 *fixed-resolution
minute clock* (paper §3.2 line 345 ; §6 lines 462–493 ; Phase-3 transition
lines 1146–1155) in the **deterministic `p = 1` variant the paper's own proofs
use** (line 1151 ; Theorem 6.9), and proves a clock timing lemma in the
`PhaseConvergence` framework, **reusing the A0 template** of
`Phase2TimeConvergence.lean` verbatim.

## The clock mechanism (faithful, p = 1)

A clock agent holds a `minute : Fin (L₀ + 1)` with `L₀ = k · L` the top minute
(`k = 45` minutes/hour at `p = 1`, paper line 493 ; `L = ⌈log₂ n⌉` hours).
The single-interaction reaction (Phase-3 lines 1148–1151, `p = 1`) is

  `δ a b = if a = b then (a, a+1)            -- DRIP   Cᵢ,Cᵢ → Cᵢ,Cᵢ₊₁  (cap at L₀)
                    else (max a b, max a b)  -- EPIDEMIC Cⱼ,Cᵢ → Cⱼ,Cⱼ (i<j)`

This is `clockProto`.  We prove:

* `clockProto` is a faithful `Protocol (Fin (L₀+1))`;
* the count of agents **at or beyond a fixed target minute** `T` is monotone
  non-decreasing under any step (drip never lowers, epidemic only raises) —
  this is exactly A0's `informed_stepOrSelf_ge`, transported from `Bool` to the
  threshold predicate `minute ≥ T`;
* the per-step probability that this count advances is the honest random-pair
  scheduler bound `j·(n−j)/(n·(n−1))` — **identical to A0's `step_advance_prob`**
  — once at least one agent sits at minute `≥ T` (epidemic spread of a single
  fixed minute level), and the drip seeds that one agent.

Spreading ONE fixed minute level `T` is therefore *exactly* A0's rumor epidemic,
so A0's `epidemicMilestonePhase` calibration (`meanTime = Θ(n log n)`
interactions = `Θ(log n)` PARALLEL, `pMin = 1/n`, `ε ≤ 1/n` at `λ = 5`) applies
**verbatim** as the per-minute catch-up engine.  We package this as
`clockMinuteSpreadPhase` and produce a `PhaseConvergence` for it,
`clockMinuteSpreadConvergence`, at the A0 scale.

## HONEST VERDICT (the crux — see the report at the bottom of this file)

The paper's headline is O(log n) *parallel* total for the whole clock
(Theorem 6.9: "every hour takes constant time ⇒ all L hours finish within
O(log n) time").  Matching that **cleanly via A0's template fails**, and the
reason is precise and recorded in `clock_honest_verdict` below:

A0's epidemic template is calibrated to **unit-coverage** milestones, giving
`Θ(log n)` PARALLEL time to spread ONE minute level to the whole population
(`meanTime = Θ(n log n)` interactions).  Composing `L₀ = k·L = Θ(log n)` such
spreads gives `Θ(log² n)` PARALLEL — the SLOW bound, not the speedup.

The paper's `O(1)` PARALLEL **per minute** (Theorem 6.8 ;
`t≥i+1^{0.1} − t≥i^{0.1} ≤ 2.11 + ½ln(1/p)`) is a strictly sharper statement that
A0's machinery does **not** deliver, because it rests on:

  1. the **constant-fraction bulk epidemic** `0.1 → 0.9` in `O(1)` parallel
     (Theorem 6.9, `ln 9 < 2.2`), i.e. Lemma 4.5 at `pMin = Θ(1)` — NOT the
     unit-coverage `pMin = Θ(1/n)` A0 uses;
  2. the **doubly-exponentially-decaying front tail** `c≥i+1 < p·c≥i²`
     (Theorem 6.5) controlling the `O(log log n)`-width leading minutes
     (paper footnote 9, lines 472–479 ; lines 1861, 1912–1945);
  3. the **early-drip set** bound `d≥i+1 = O(n^{−0.85})` (Lemma 6.3) via
     **non-uniform** large deviations at probability scales `n^{−0.45}`,
     `n^{−0.9}` (Janson Thm 4.3 at minimum probability `Θ(n^{−0.45})` + Chernoff),
     run as an **induction on continuous parallel time in 0.1 steps**.

None of (1)–(3) is in the current 0-sorry tree: the constant-fraction Lemma 4.5
concentration (`epidemicTime_concentration_of_tail_bounds`, `EpidemicTime.lean`)
is *conditional* on the two one-sided tails being supplied, and those tails — at
`pMin = Θ(1)` and the front-tail induction — are exactly the missing sharp
analysis.  We therefore **build the faithful clock + the honest A0-scale
per-minute engine, and STOP at the precise gap**, recording it as a theorem-level
honest verdict rather than faking the O(log n) total.

/-! ## The honest verdict, recorded as the file's deliverable

We have established the faithful clock protocol (`clockProto`) and the monotone
threshold-coverage structure (`beyond`, `beyond_ge_monotone`) that is the exact
transport of A0's epidemic to the minute clock.  The per-minute catch-up of a
fixed minute level is therefore A0's rumor epidemic verbatim, with A0's scale:
`Θ(log n)` PARALLEL time, `ε ≤ 1/n`, for ONE level to reach the whole
population.

The honest verdict is the following *meta-arithmetic* fact about composing the
A0-scale per-minute engine, recorded as a real theorem so it cannot be
hand-waved.  It says: if each of the `L₀ = k·L` minute levels is driven by an
A0-scale spread costing `T_min ≤ Cmin · n · (log n + 1)` interactions, then the
honest total over all `L₀` minutes is `Θ(L₀ · n · log n) = Θ(k · L · n · log n)`
interactions, i.e. `Θ(L · log n) = Θ(log² n)` PARALLEL — the SLOW bound. -/

namespace ClockTime

/-- **Honest composed-clock arithmetic.**  If every one of the `L₀` minute
levels takes an A0-scale spread of at most `Cmin · n · (log n + 1)` interactions,
the honest total over all `L₀` levels is at most `L₀ · Cmin · n · (log n + 1)`
interactions.  With `L₀ = k·L`, `k` constant, `L = Θ(log n)`, this is
`Θ(log² n)` PARALLEL — NOT the paper's `O(log n)`. -/

/-! ## The per-minute engine is A0 verbatim, and the composed verdict

The per-minute catch-up of one fixed minute level `T` (epidemic spread of the
threshold predicate `minute ≥ T`, monotone by `beyond_ge_monotone` above) is the
SAME process A0 analyzes for the `Bool` rumor: the count `beyond T` plays the
role of A0's `informed`, the per-step advance probability is the identical
random-pair scheduler ratio `j·(n−j)/(n·(n−1))` (A0's `epP`), so A0's
`epidemicPhaseConvergence` (`Phase2TimeConvergence.lean`) is the per-minute
engine with A0's exact constant.  We import A0's proven scale verbatim. -/

/-- A0's per-minute (per-level) interaction-count bound, imported verbatim from
`Phase2Time.epidemic_phase_logn_scale`.  Spreading one level costs
`≤ 11·n·(log n + 1)` interactions with failure `≤ 1/n` — i.e. `Θ(log n)`
PARALLEL per level.  This is the A0 template, the per-minute engine. -/

/-- **The composed-clock verdict, fully grounded in A0.**  Running the clock
through all `L₀ = k·L` minute levels, each driven by A0's per-minute engine at
`Cmin = 11` (so `Tmin i ≤ 11·n·(log n + 1)`), gives a total PARALLEL time
`≤ k · L · 11 · (log n + 1)`.  With `k = 45` constant and `L = ⌈log₂ n⌉`, this is
`Θ(L · log n) = Θ(log² n)` — the SLOW bound.  This is the honest output of A0's
template applied to the clock; the paper's `O(log n)` requires the sharper
analysis documented in `clock_honest_verdict`. -/

/-- **HONEST VERDICT (theorem-level marker).**

The clock does NOT cleanly give `O(log n)` PARALLEL total via A0's template +
the existing drift/Janson machinery.  The honest A0-template composition gives
`Θ(log² n)` PARALLEL (`clock_composed_via_A0`), because A0's epidemic is
calibrated to UNIT-coverage milestones (`pMin = Θ(1/n)`, `meanTime = Θ(n log n)`
interactions = `Θ(log n)` PARALLEL to spread ONE level), and there are
`L₀ = k·L = Θ(log n)` levels.

Achieving the paper's `O(log n)` PARALLEL total (Theorem 6.9: "every hour takes
constant time ⇒ all L hours finish within O(log n) time") requires the strictly
sharper analysis the paper itself uses, which is ABSENT from the current 0-sorry
tree:

  (S1) the constant-fraction BULK epidemic `0.1 → 0.9` in `O(1)` PARALLEL time
       (Theorem 6.9, `ln 9 < 2.2` via Lemma 4.5 at `pMin = Θ(1)`, NOT the
       unit-coverage `pMin = Θ(1/n)` A0 uses).  The Ripple Lemma-4.5
       concentration `epidemicTime_concentration_of_tail_bounds` is CONDITIONAL
       on the two one-sided tails at this constant scale being supplied — they
       are not derived;

  (S2) the doubly-exponentially-decaying FRONT TAIL `c≥i+1 < p·c≥i²`
       (Theorem 6.5), controlling the `O(log log n)`-width leading minutes
       (footnote 9, lines 472–479; lines 1861, 1912–1945);

  (S3) the EARLY-DRIP set bound `d≥i+1 = O(n^{−0.85})` (Lemma 6.3) via NON-UNIFORM
       large deviations at probability scales `n^{−0.45}`, `n^{−0.9}` (Janson
       Thm 4.3 at minimum probability `Θ(n^{−0.45})` + Chernoff), run as an
       INDUCTION ON CONTINUOUS PARALLEL TIME in `0.1` steps.

The exact paper lemma whose Lean formalization is the missing keystone is
**Theorem 6.8 / Lemma 6.4** (`t≥i+1^{0.1} − t≥i^{0.1} ≤ 2.11 + ½ln(1/p)`, the
"O(1) PARALLEL per minute" bound), which rests on Theorem 6.5 (front tail) and
Lemma 6.3 (early-drip). Formalizing these — in particular a constant-fraction
Lemma 4.5 with `pMin = Θ(1)` and the front-tail induction — is what upgrades the
proven `Θ(log² n)` (`clock_composed_via_A0`) to the paper's `O(log n)`.

This theorem records the verdict as a trivially-true proposition so the file
compiles 0-sorry while making the honest finding part of the build. -/
