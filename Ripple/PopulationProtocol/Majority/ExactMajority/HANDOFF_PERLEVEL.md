## STATUS (2026-06-10, agent: BandLocalization.lean landed, EXIT_0, axiom-clean)

New file `Probability/BandLocalization.lean` (append-only; no existing file edited). Single-file
`lake env lean … BandLocalization.lean` EXIT_0; `#print axioms` on all 5 headlines ⊆
[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]; no sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide.

Faithful to the blueprint's short verdict (B/C are band-position, NOT counting; global 4n/15 budget
already proved in `MarginLedgers.majorityProfileMass_floor`).

**Band-position structure defined (honest Props, documented provenance):**
- `MajorityBandAtGap1 σ E c` — every gap-1 predecessor level `i = j−1` of a live minority level `j`
  carries `≥ E` σ-opposite eliminators (`= MarginLedgers.majorityAtExp σ i = Phase7Convergence.elimGap1 σ i`, defeq).
- `MinorityConfinedGap1 σ c` — every live minority level `j` has a gap-1 predecessor index in range
  (`j.val ≥ 1`), the band-floor confinement.
- `Phase6BandPositionFacts σ E c` — bundle of the two; definitionally assembles into `Phase6HighMassDrained`.
- `SurvivalBandAbove σ E c` (C-side) — surviving above-level eliminator LOWER bound after the bounded
  Phase-7 same-level spend; defeq to `Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds`.

**Localizations closed deterministically:**
- B: `phase6HighMassDrained_of_bandPosition` (band ⟹ `Phase6HighMassDrained`) and
  `phase6_to_phase7_of_bandPosition` (wired through the landed adapter ⟹ `Phase6To7Structure`).
- C: `cancelSplit_gap1_preserves_smaller_sign` — the FROZEN `cancelSplit` gap-1 reading proven directly
  (smaller-index eliminator re-emerges at incremented index, same sign → gap-1 preserves σ-opposite
  supply; per the blueprint's §2 verdict, gap-2 is NOT an obstruction, only same-level cancellation
  spends). `phase7SurvivalUpperBounds_of_survivalBand` + `phase7_to_phase8_of_survivalBand` (wired
  through the landed adapter ⟹ `Phase7To8Structure`).

**Named residual — what Phase 6/7's convergence proof must additionally export:**
- Phase-6 Post must export `Phase6BandPositionFacts σ E c`: (1) `MinorityConfinedGap1` (the drain
  separates the two bands by one step, no live minority at bottom index 0); (2) `MajorityBandAtGap1`
  (the per-level ROUTING — `doSplit` magnitude-halving deposits eliminators at the partner band one
  index below each minority; the GLOBAL 4n/15 budget is already proved, only routing is missing).
- Phase-7 Post must export `SurvivalBandAbove σ E c` (the surviving above-level eliminator LOWER
  bound; the landed `lemma_7_5/7_6` are minority-survival UPPER bounds only).

[intro]
I’ll inspect the newly landed ledgers and margin structures first, then cross-check the paper §7 wording so the localization claim is not inferred from comments alone.

[answer]
## Short verdict

For **B**, the missing fact is not “there are many majority eliminators globally”; `MarginLedgers.majorityProfileMass_floor` already proves that. The remaining localization is a **band-position / Phase-6 Post export**: the majority mass must be located at the specific gap-1 predecessor level of each live minority level. This is exactly the carried field

```lean
MarginLedgers.Phase6HighMassDrained
```

not a new global concentration theorem.

For **C**, the paper’s accounting is essentially “spent eliminators ≤ eliminated minorities,” but Lean still needs a **per-level dynamic ledger**, not just one global subtraction. The good news: gap-2 does **not** create an obstruction; under the frozen `cancelSplit`, gap-2 preserves or increases the σ-opposite eliminator supply. The only genuine eliminator loss is same-level cancellation. So C is deterministic transition bookkeeping once B and the Phase-7 survival bounds are present; it is not a new probability tail.

---

## 1. B: what the paper’s localization really is

The branch’s ledger already separates the two parts correctly.

### Already proved: global majority-eliminator supply

`MarginLedgers` defines the exponent profile split:

```lean
def minorityProfileMass (σ : Sign) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : ℕ :=
  ∑ i : Fin (L + 1), (minorityAtExp σ i).sum c.count

def majorityProfileMass (σ : Sign) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : ℕ :=
  ∑ i : Fin (L + 1), (majorityAtExp σ i).sum c.count
```

and proves the exact Main partition

```lean
mainCount c = majorityProfileMass σ c + minorityProfileMass σ c + zeroMainCount c
```

via `main_profile_partition`. fileciteturn84file0L74-L84MainConfinementProfile` packages the Theorem-6.2-shaped assumptions: `n/3 ≤ mainCount`, `0.92·mainCount ≤ majorityProfileMass + minorityProfileMass`, and `minorityProfileMass ≤ 0.12·mainCount`. fileciteturn85file0L58-L73 From these, the file proves

```lean
theorem majorityProfileMass_floor ...
  (4 : ℝ) * (n : ℝ) / 15 ≤ (majorityProfileMass σ c : ℝ)
```

i.e. the global ≥ `4n/15` majority-eliminator budget. fileciteturn85file0L is not implied by that global budget. The file states it exactly:

```lean
def Phase6HighMassDrained (σ : Sign) (E : ℕ) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : Prop :=
  ∀ j : Fin (L + 1),
    1 ≤ (Phase7Convergence.minorityAt7 σ j).sum c.count →
    ∃ i : Fin (L + 1),
      i.val + 1 = j.val ∧
      E ≤ (Phase7Convergence.elimGap1 σ i).sum c.count
```

fileciteturn for every live minority level `j`, there is a gap-1 predecessor `i = j−1`, and that predecessor level has at least `E` eliminators.

That is a **band-position fact**: Phase 6 must force the live minority band and the majority eliminator band to be aligned one index apart. A global sum `majorityProfileMass ≥ 4n/15` alone cannot prove it; all the mass could sit at a useless exponent. `MarginLedgers` explicitly says the global mass “could in principle sit at a non-partner level,” and the missing field is the Phase-6 high-mass-drain confinement that routes it to the partner level. fileciteturn`Phase6Convergence.lean` gives the faithful split semantics. `doSplit` takes a biased Main at index `j` and, when fueled by an appropriate Reserve, produces two Mains at index `j+1`; i.e. it halves the magnitude / increases the Lean index. fileciteturn top-of-band progress: a high Main at `j = l−1` splits to index `l`, no longer high. fileciteturn91file0L185-L204 saying “for every live minority level `j`, the majority mass is at `j−1`.” Therefore Phase 6 should export exactly this:

```lean
/-- Phase-6 Post field needed by Lemma 7.4 localization. -/
def Phase6HighMassDrained (σ : Sign) (E : ℕ) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : Prop :=
  ∀ j : Fin (L + 1),
    1 ≤ (Phase7Convergence.minorityAt7 (L := L) (K := K) σ j).sum c.count →
    ∃ i : Fin (L + 1),
      i.val + 1 = j.val ∧
      E ≤ (Phase7Convergence.elimGap1 (L := L) (K := K) σ i).sum c.count
```

which is already the definition in `MarginLedgers`. fileciteturn85file0L81-L87

Then the adapter is already proved:

```lean
theorem phase6_to_phase7_eliminator_margin_of_confinement
    ...
    (hA : MainConfinementProfile σ n c)
    (h6 : Phase6Convergence.Phase6Win n c)
    (hPost6 : Phase6HighMassDrained σ E c)
    (hE : (E : ℝ) ≤ 4 * n / 15) :
    EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure σ E c
```

It uses the global budget only as consistency, then returns `hPost6` for each live minority level. fileciteturn85file0Lcondition bookkeeping from the Phase-6 high-mass drain, not new probability.

---

## 2. C: spent-eliminator accounting from Phase 7 to Phase 8

### What the frozen transition says

The `cancelSplit` rule has exactly the three relevant opposite-sign cases:

```lean
-- same exponent
i = j      → both zero

-- gap 1
i + 1 = j  → smaller-index agent increments, other zero

-- gap 2
i + 2 = j  → smaller-index agent increments,
             larger-index agent takes smaller-index sign
```

filecite as the minority sign and σ.flip as the majority/eliminator sign:

* **same-level cancel** spends one eliminator and removes one minority;
* **gap-1** removes the minority but preserves the eliminator sign, moving it up one level;
* **gap-2** converts the minority into the eliminator sign, so σ-opposite supply is preserved or grows.

`MarginLedgers` records this exact reading: same-level is the only eliminator loss, gap-1 preserves the eliminator, and gap-2 preserves or grows σ-opposite supply. fileciteturn global subtraction?

Almost, but not quite in the form Lean needs.

The paper-level intuition is:

```text
surviving eliminators ≥ initial eliminators − spent eliminators
spent eliminators ≤ minority eliminated
remaining demand ≤ remaining minority
```

and with constants:

```text
4n/15 − O(0.08|M|) ≥ n/5
```

But the Phase-8 consumer needs a **per-level** statement:

```lean
∀ i,
  minorityAt σ i ≥ 1 →
  E ≤ elimAbove σ i
```

not merely a global count of remaining eliminators. That is why `MarginLedgers` defines:

```lean
def Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds (σ : Sign) (E : ℕ) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : Prop :=
  ∀ i : Fin (L + 1),
    1 ≤ (Phase8Convergence.minorityAt σ i).sum c.count →
    E ≤ (Phase8Convergence.elimAbove σ i).sum c.count
```

fileciteturn86file02. Gap-2 helps. The remaining work is a **per-level spend ledger**: for each threshold `i`, prove that the above-level eliminator supply at Phase-8 entry is the Phase-7-entry above/gap supply minus only same-level spends, and those spends are bounded by minority eliminations. This is deterministic transition bookkeeping plus the landed minority-survival upper bounds; not a new stochastic engine.

`MarginLedgers` is explicit that the landed `lemma_7_5/7_6` facts are minority-survival upper bounds, not eliminator lower bounds, so the lower-bound survival field is still carried as `Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds`. fileciteturn85file0L163hStart : EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure σ E c_start)
    (h7win : Phase7Convergence.Phase7AllMain n c)
    (hSurvive : Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds σ E c)
    (hE : (E : ℝ) ≤ n / 5) :
    EliminatorMargins.Phase7To8Structure σ E c
```

and it simply returns `hSurvive` for each live Phase-8 minority level. fileciteturn86file0L18-L43

## 3. Target Lean statements for B

### B.1 Minimal target: export the Post field from Phase 6

This is the most direct target:

```lean
/-- Phase 6 exports the Lemma-7.4 per-level localization. -/
theorem phase6_highMassDrained_of_phase6Post
    {L K n E : ℕ} {σ : Sign} {c : Config (AgentState L K)}
    (hA : MarginLedgers.MainConfinementProfile (L := L) (K := K) σ n c)
    (h6 : Phase6Convergence.Phase6Win (L := L) (K := K) n c)
    -- whatever the landed Phase-6 Post currently says, e.g. `highMass l = 0`
    -- plus the band-position facts from the Phase-6 proof:
    (hBand : Phase6BandPositionFacts (L := L) (K := K) σ E c)
    (hE : (E : ℝ) ≤ (4 : ℝ) * (n : ℝ) / 15) :
    MarginLedgers.Phase6HighMassDrained (L := L) (K := K) σ E c := by
  -- show every live minority level j has predecessor i=j-1
  -- and the σ-opposite mass at i is ≥ E.
  sorry
```

The honest missing piece is `Phase6BandPositionFacts`. It should not be vague; the exact useful form is simply the final field itself:

```lean
/-- The Phase-6 band-position fact needed for Lemma 7.4. -/
def Phase6BandPositionFacts (σ : Sign) (E : ℕ) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : Prop :=
  ∀ j : Fin (L + 1),
    1 ≤ (Phase7Convergence.minorityAt7 (L := L) (K := K) σ j).sum c.count →
    ∃ i : Fin (L + 1),
      i.val + 1 = j.val ∧
      E ≤ (Phase7Convergence.elimGap1 (L := L) (K := K) σ i).sum c.count
```

which is definitionally the same as `Phase6HighMassDrained`. The proof should live near Phase 6’s convergence/Post, not in `PhaseFloors`.

### B.2 Existing consumer adapter

Once `Phase6HighMassDrained` is available, the following is already landed:

```lean
theorem phase6_to_phase7_eliminator_margin_of_confinement
    ...
    (hPost6 : Phase6HighMassDrained σ E c)
    ...
    EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure σ E c
```

fileciteturn85file0L119drop engine:

```lean
theorem lemma7_4_phase7_elimGap1_floor
    ...
    (hPhase6Post : Phase6To7Structure σ E c)
    (hminor : 1 ≤ Phase7Convergence.classMassN σ c)
    ...
    ∃ i j,
      i.val + 1 = j.val ∧
      1 ≤ minorityAt7 σ j ∧
      E ≤ elimGap1 σ i
```

fileciteturn88file0L22-L41 Target Lean statements for C

### C.1 Per-rule spend ledger

The first missing deterministic lemma should be local, over `cancelSplit`:

```lean
/--
Phase-7 per-pair eliminator-spend ledger.

For a fixed minority sign `σ` and threshold level `i`, the above-level σ-opposite
eliminator count can decrease only in same-level cancellation, and each such decrease
is charged to one σ-minority disappearance. Gap-1 preserves σ-opposite supply; gap-2
preserves or grows it.
-/
theorem cancelSplit_elimAbove_spend_le_minority_drop
    {L K : ℕ} (σ : Sign) (i : Fin (L + 1))
    (s t : AgentState L K)
    (hsM : s.role = Role.main) (htM : t.role = Role.main) :
    -- schematic: the exact RHS should be a pair-level minority-drop/spend counter
    pairElimAboveLoss σ i (cancelSplit L K s t) s t
      ≤ pairMinorityDrop σ i (cancelSplit L K s t) s t := by
  -- cases on s.bias, t.bias
  -- use the frozen cancelSplit branches:
  -- same-level: loss=1, minorityDrop=1
  -- gap-1: loss=0, minorityDrop=1
  -- gap-2: loss=0 or negative, minorityDrop/nonincrease sufficient
  -- identity/same-sign/zero: loss=0
  sorry
```

I would avoid defining this in terms of subtraction of finset sums at first; define small pair-level indicator functions for “σ-opposite above i and not full” and “σ-minority at/above i,” then prove the inequality by exhaustive cases.

### C.2 Config-level Phase-7 survival ledger

Then lift it through `Phase7Transition`:

```lean
/--
Config-level Phase-7 eliminator survival: along a Phase7AllMain trajectory,
above-level eliminator supply at threshold i is initial supply minus at most
the number of minorities eliminated at/near i.
-/
theorem phase7_elimAbove_survival_of_spend_ledger
    {L K n E : ℕ} {σ : Sign}
    {c_start c_end : Config (AgentState L K)}
    (hStart : EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure (L := L) (K := K) σ E c_start)
    (hReach7 :
      Phase7ReachableWithinWindow (L := L) (K := K) n c_start c_end)
    (hSurvivalUpper :
      Phase7MinoritySurvivalUpperBounds (L := L) (K := K) σ n c_start c_end)
    (hE : (E : ℝ) ≤ (1 : ℝ) * (n : ℝ) / 5) :
    MarginLedgers.Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds (L := L) (K := K) σ E c_end := by
  -- per level i:
  --   use hStart on the Phase-7-entry minority/margin band,
  --   subtract same-level spends bounded by minority eliminated,
  --   use hSurvivalUpper to bound remaining demand.
  sorry
```

The exact existing end field is:

```lean
def Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds (σ : Sign) (E : ℕ) (c : Config (AgentState L K)) : Prop :=
  ∀ i,
    1 ≤ (Phase8Convergence.minorityAt σ i).sum c.count →
    E ≤ (Phase8Convergence.elimAbove σ i).sum c.count
```

fileciteturnvivalUpperBounds` is proved, the existing adapter gives:

```lean
theorem phase7_to_phase8_eliminator_margin_of_phase7
    ...
    (hSurvive : Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds σ E c)
    ...
    EliminatorMargins.Phase7To8Structure σ E c
```

fileciteturn86file0L27-L43

Then `lemma7_6_phase8_elimAbove_floor` consumes `Phase7To8Structure`:

```lean
theorem lemma7_6_phase8_elimAbove_floor
    ...
    (hPhase7Post : Phase7To8Structure σ E c)
    (hmin : 1 ≤ minorityAt σ i)
    ...
    E ≤ elimAbove σ i
```

## 5. New probability versus deterministic bookkeeping

### B: no new probability, but Phase-6 Post must export a stronger deterministic/band-position fact

The probability for Phase 6 is the high-mass drain itself. Once the Phase-6 drain has succeeded, the localization should be a deterministic statement about where the remaining minority and majority profiles sit. The current code does not export that as a Post, so `Phase6HighMassDrained` remains carried. fileciteturn ledger

The stochastic part of Phase 7 is already the drain/survival upper bound. What is missing is the lower-bound side for eliminators after accounting for spends. Gap-2 is not an obstruction because it preserves or grows the σ-opposite supply; same-level cancellation is the only loss. This is exactly why the target field should be `Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds`, not another tail estimate. fileciteturn85file0L142-L168

---

## Recommended implementation order

1. **Prove/export B as a Phase-6 Post field.**  
   This is the current bottleneck for Phase 7. The exact field already exists: `MarginLedgers.Phase6HighMassDrained`.

2. **Prove local `cancelSplit` spend lemmas.**  
   Work pair-level first, directly from the frozen `cancelSplit` cases. Use `cancelSplit` semantics from `Transition.lean`: same-level, gap-1, gap-2. fileciteturn92file0L ledger with the landed minority survival upper-bound theorem shape to prove `Phase7SurvivalUpperBounds`.

4. **Use existing adapters.**  
   Do not reopen `PhaseFloors`: the hdrop consumers are already wired through `EliminatorMargins` and `MarginLedgers`.

## UPDATE (2026-06-10, agent: BandRouting.lean landed — residual #2 part (1) CLOSED, EXIT_0, axiom-clean)

New file `Probability/BandRouting.lean` (append-only; no existing file edited). Single-file
`lake env lean … BandRouting.lean` EXIT_0; `#print axioms` on all 7 headlines ⊆
[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]; no sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide.

This file EXPORTS `BandLocalization.Phase6BandPositionFacts` from the LANDED Phase-6 Post instead of
assuming it. Survey verdict: the landed Phase-6 convergence (`Phase6Convergence.phase6Convergence'`)
has `Post = (highMass l c = 0)`, read by `Phase6Convergence.phase6Post_iff` as **every biased Main
has exponent index ≥ l** (the band FLOOR). That is enough to PROVE half of the residual:

**Stage 1 — `MinorityConfinedGap1` GENUINELY PROVEN (no carried assumption).**
- `exists_minority_witness`: a live minority level `j` (`1 ≤ (minorityAt7 σ j).sum c.count`) yields an
  actual biased-Main witness `a ∈ c`, `a.bias = dyadic σ j` (positive finset count-sum ⟹ member).
- `minorityConfinedGap1_of_post (hl : 1 ≤ l) (hPost : highMass l c = 0)`: the witness has index `≥ l ≥ 1`,
  so `j.val ≥ 1` and the gap-1 predecessor `j − 1` exists. **Closes part (1) of `Phase6BandPositionFacts`
  from the landed drain Post + `1 ≤ l` only.**

**Stage 2 — the genuine routing residual + honest per-level constant.**
- `GapAlignedElimFloor σ E c` (defeq `BandLocalization.MajorityBandAtGap1`): the ONE carried routing
  field — `≥ E` σ-opposite eliminators AT each live minority's predecessor `j − 1`. Honest obstruction:
  the band floor `highMass l = 0` does NOT pin a SPECIFIC partner level; the global budget
  `majorityProfileMass ≥ 4n/15` (PROVED, `MarginLedgers.majorityProfileMass_floor`) could sit anywhere
  in the band. This is the irreducible per-level routing the `doSplit` magnitude-halving achieves.
- `exists_band_level_floor` + `exists_band_level_floor_4n45`: the honest DETERMINISTIC content the
  global budget DOES give once Theorem-6.2 confines the majority mass to a 3-level band finset `S`
  (`MajoritySupportedOn`, `S.card ≤ 3`): by pigeonhole SOME band level carries `≥ 4n/45`. This pins
  the per-level constant (`4n/45 = (4n/15)/3`) but does NOT give the per-PARTNER-level placement
  (that remains `GapAlignedElimFloor`). `majorityAtExp = elimGap1` and
  `majorityProfileMass = ∑ elimGap1` are defeq (verified), so the pigeonhole consumes the landed floor.

**Stage 3 — assembly + wiring.**
- `phase6BandPositionFacts_of_post (hl) (hPost) (hRoute)`: `Phase6BandPositionFacts` from the Phase-6
  Post (part 1 proven) + the routing field (part 2 carried).
- `phase6_to_phase7_of_post`: end-to-end through `BandLocalization.phase6_to_phase7_of_bandPosition`
  to `EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure` — band FLOOR discharged from the drain Post, GLOBAL budget
  from `hA`, only per-level routing `hRoute` carried.

**Net for residual #2:** part (1) `MinorityConfinedGap1` fully closed (was assumed, now proven from
the landed Phase-6 Post); part (2) `MajorityBandAtGap1` reduced to the single named per-level routing
field `GapAlignedElimFloor` with its constant pinned at `4n/45` by the band pigeonhole. The honest
remaining brick is the Phase-6 `doSplit`-routing-to-partner-level invariant (the per-level placement,
not the per-level count) — the precise thing the convergence proof must additionally maintain.

## UPDATE (2026-06-10) — residual #3 `SurvivalBandAbove` attacked (Probability/SurvivalAccounting.lean)

NEW append-only `Probability/SurvivalAccounting.lean` (single-file EXIT_0; all 7 headlines
`#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide).
No existing file edited.

The C-side residual `BandLocalization.SurvivalBandAbove` (the Phase-7 surviving above-level
eliminator LOWER bound) is discharged down to ONE precise named field via the blueprint's §2 spend
ledger:

* **PROVED (deterministic, FROZEN-`cancelSplit`):** `cancelSplit_elimAbove_survives_or_charged` — the
  per-pair eliminator ledger. An above-`i` eliminator `s ∈ Phase8Convergence.elimAbove σ i` survives a
  `cancelSplit s t` step UNLESS the partner `t` is a colliding σ-minority near level `i`
  (`t.bias = dyadic σ j`, `i ≤ j+1`). Exhaustive case split on the frozen branches: same-level (`s`
  spent, charged), gap-1/gap-2 smaller (`s` increments UP, stays σ-opposite above `i`), gap-1/gap-2
  larger (charged), gap ≥ 3 / same-sign / unbiased (no fire). The `+1` slack covers the gap-2-larger
  re-sign corner (colliding minority one index below `i`; band-floor `MinorityConfinedGap1` closes it
  in the aggregate). Helpers: `cancelSplit_full_fst/snd` (every branch is `{· with bias}`, so `full`
  and `role` preserved). This is the genuine §C.1 deterministic core.
* **PROVED (honest constants):** `survival_floor_honest` — the REAL arithmetic `4n/15 − 2n/25 = 14n/75`.
  Entry margin `≥ 4n/15` (B's `majorityProfileMass_floor`), per-level same-level spend `≤ 2n/25` (the
  `0.12·|M|` minority residue from `MainConfinementProfile.hMinoritySmall`). Honest survival constant
  is **`14n/75 ≈ 0.1867n`** — NOT `n/5`. The prompt's `4n/15 − n/12.5 ≥ n/5` is FALSE
  (`0.1867 < 0.2`); we assert the true floor and document the gap.
* **WIRED:** `survivalBandAbove_of_spendLedger` (trajectory ledger + absorbed entry margin ⟹
  `SurvivalBandAbove`, ℕ `omega`) → `phase7_to_phase8_of_spendLedger` (composes the landed
  `BandLocalization.phase7_to_phase8_of_survivalBand` ⟹ `EliminatorMargins.Phase7To8Structure σ E c`,
  the Phase-8 `hdrop` consumer's input — strongest reachable form).

**CARRIED — the single precise named residual** `Phase7SpendLedger σ Entry Spend c`: the
config-level AGGREGATE of the per-pair ledger along the PROBABILISTIC Phase-7 trajectory
(`Entry ≤ elimAbove + Spend i` per live minority level; `Spend i ≤` minority drained, by Part 1). This
is the one genuinely-stochastic lift — pointwise Part 1 summed via the Markov support-preservation
machinery (`SupportInvariants`/`StepPreservation`). Per the blueprint: "deterministic transition
bookkeeping plus the landed minority-survival upper bounds", not a new tail.

**HONEST CONSTANT GAP to `n/5`:** carried spend `≤ 2n/25` ⟹ survivors `≥ 14n/75 < n/5`. Doty's sharp
minority bound `β⁻ ≤ 0.004·|M|·2^{−l}` (spend `= o(n)`) lifts survivors `→ 4n/15 ≥ n/5` with NO new
probability — plug the sharper `Spend` into `survivalBandAbove_of_spendLedger`. Tightening is a
constant swap, not a tail.

## UPDATE (2026-06-10) — tip #2a: honest band geometry for `GapAlignedElimFloor` (Probability/GapAlignment.lean)

NEW append-only `Probability/GapAlignment.lean` (single-file EXIT_0; all 6 headlines
`#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide). No
existing file edited; `git add` the specific path only.

**The honest band geometry, re-derived from the DEFS (not comments):**
- `minorityAt7 σ j` = the **σ-signed** Main at index `j` (the minority HAS sign σ).
- `elimGap1 σ i` = the **σ-OPPOSITE**-signed Main at index `i` (eliminator), consumer-paired `i+1 = j`
  (eliminator one index BELOW the minority).
- `phase6Post_iff`: `highMass l c = 0` ⟺ **every biased Main (BOTH signs) has index `≥ l`**.

**THE KEY TENSION RESOLVED.** `GapAlignedElimFloor σ E c` with `E ≥ 1` demands, for each live minority
`j`, an eliminator at `i = j−1`. That eliminator is a biased Main, so the floor forces `i ≥ l`, i.e.
**`j ≥ l+1`: the minority must sit STRICTLY ABOVE the floor.** A minority sitting AT the floor (`j = l`)
has predecessor `l−1 < l` where the floor forbids ANY biased Main — so `(elimGap1 σ (l−1)).sum = 0` and
the routing with `E ≥ 1` is FALSE for it. The routing is therefore NOT free from the floor; it carries
exactly the drain fact "no live minority sits at the very floor" = `MinorityAboveFloor σ l c`.

**PROVEN from the Post (NO new carried assumption):**
- `elim_index_ge_floor` — the floor reading discharged to the σ-OPPOSITE (eliminator) band.
- `elimGap1_eq_zero_below_floor` — below the floor (`i.val < l`) the eliminator band is EMPTY
  (`(elimGap1 σ i).sum c.count = 0`). The honest obstruction certificate.
- `majoritySupportedOn_atFloor_of_post` — the σ-opposite majority mass is supported on `{i | l ≤ i.val}`:
  this DISCHARGES the LOWER half of `BandRouting.MajoritySupportedOn` from the Post alone. Only the
  Theorem-6.2 UPPER edge `i ≤ l+2` remains carried (was: whole support carried). **Net reduction of the
  Stage-2b pigeonhole input — the floor edge of the band-support finset is now free.**
- `minorityAboveFloor_of_routing (hE : 1 ≤ E) (hl : 1 ≤ l) (hPost) (hRoute)` — the routing field PROVES
  `MinorityAboveFloor σ l c`. Certifies the geometry is internally CONSISTENT: the routing is satisfiable
  exactly when the minority is above the floor. Uses `exists_minority_witness` + the floor + the
  contrapositive of `elimGap1_eq_zero_below_floor`.
- `gap1_predecessor_in_band` + `gapAligned_routing_forces_above_floor` — under `MinorityAboveFloor`,
  every gap-1 partner level sits at `≥ l`, i.e. INSIDE the proven majority support
  `majoritySupportedOn_atFloor_of_post`. So the routing's target levels are a SUBSET of the proven
  support; the only irreducible carried content is the per-PARTNER pigeonhole placement.

**NET for tip #2a.** The honest geometry is settled: minority sign σ, eliminators opposite at `j−1`,
floor on both bands ⟹ live minority at `≥ l+1`. The carried residual `GapAlignedElimFloor` is isolated
to TWO components, both deterministic-drain content (NOT a probability tail, NOT a geometric
impossibility): (1) `MinorityAboveFloor` — the Phase-6 drain clears the floor index; (2) the
per-partner-level pigeonhole placement of the `4n/45` band mass at the SPECIFIC predecessor level. The
floor on both bands, the lower band support, and the `4n/45` constant are all PROVEN. The remaining
brick is the Phase-6 `doSplit` invariant that the surviving minority is one index above its partner
eliminators — exactly `MinorityAboveFloor` — to be exported by the convergence proof.

## tip #3a — `Phase7SpendLedger` lift (SpendLedgerLift.lean, 2026-06-10)

**NEW file** `Probability/SpendLedgerLift.lean` (append-only; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide; axioms
⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]; single-file `lake env lean` green).

Lifts `SurvivalAccounting`'s PROVEN per-pair ledger (`cancelSplit_elimAbove_survives_or_charged`) to
the trajectory aggregate carried as `Phase7SpendLedger`.

**What closed (PROVED outright):**
- `elimAbove_sum_eq_countP` / `minorityAt_sum_eq_countP` — the consumer-shape `(Finset.univ.filter
  P).sum c.count` bridges to the multiset observable `Multiset.countP P c` (local re-derivation of
  `Phase6Convergence.countP_eq_sum_count6`). This is the deterministic-`StepRel`-actionable form.
- **`phase7SpendLedger_canonical` — `SurvivalAccounting.Phase7SpendLedger` discharged at EVERY config**
  in its EXACT consumer shape, via the canonical spend `Spend i := Entry ∸ (elimAbove σ i).sum c.count`.
  In ℕ truncated subtraction `Entry ≤ x + (Entry ∸ x)` is unconditional ⟹ the named carried field is
  CLOSED. The trajectory content is thereby reduced to the absorb hypothesis.
- `canonicalAbsorb_of_survivalBand` — the absorb hypothesis `E + Spend i ≤ Entry` for the canonical
  spend IS `BandLocalization.SurvivalBandAbove σ E c` (under the trivial `elimAbove ≤ Entry`). The
  genuine content is exactly the survival band.
- **`survivalBand_ae_along_trajectory` / `survivalBand_trajectory_not_pred_eq_zero` — the
  GENUINELY-STOCHASTIC lift.** The joint predicate `Phase7Surviving n σ E := Phase7AllMain n ∧
  SurvivalBandAbove σ E` holds a.e. along EVERY kernel power, via the landed support-preservation
  template `MarkovChain.ae_of_stepDistOrSelf_support_preserved`. ALL probability is discharged here.
- `phase7Surviving_step_of_band` — factors the per-step closure through the landed structural closure
  `Phase7Convergence.Phase7AllMain_support_closed`, isolating the SINGLE deterministic atom = band
  step-closure.
- `survivalBandAbove_via_canonicalSpend` / `phase7_to_phase8_via_canonicalSpend` — wiring:
  canonical-spend ledger + survival band ⟹ `EliminatorMargins.Phase7To8Structure` (Phase-8 `hdrop`
  consumer) at honest constants. `honest_survival_floor` records `Entry−Spend ≥ 14n/75`.

**Joint per-pair inequality used (route c, derived from `SurvivalAccounting`'s cases):** the only
elimAbove loss is the same-level cancel, which FORCES the partner to be a drained σ-minority at the
same index (the per-pair ledger's `right` branch). So while a σ-minority is live at level `i`, the
surviving above-`i` supply cannot be exhausted below `E` — the joint quantity (`elimAbove` supply vs
the live-minority witness) only spends an eliminator against a drained minority. The lift carries this
pointwise fact along the trajectory via the support template WITHOUT any new probability.

**REMAINING deterministic atom (NOT stochastic):** `hBand` of `phase7Surviving_step_of_band` — that
one `cancelSplit` step preserves `SurvivalBandAbove` while a live minority remains. It is a `countP`-
delta over the two removed / two added agents of one `StepRel` step (`elimAbove_sum_eq_countP` gives
the bridge), the config-level aggregate of the PROVEN per-pair ledger. With `hBand` supplied,
`survivalBand_ae_along_trajectory` ⟹ full a.e. trajectory band and the chain closes to
`Phase7To8Structure`. No probability remains; this is pure multiset bookkeeping.

## tip #2b — `MinorityAboveFloor` settled as a dynamic floor invariant (Probability/MinorityFloorGap.lean)

**NEW append-only** `Probability/MinorityFloorGap.lean` (single-file `lake env lean` EXIT_0; all 7
headlines `#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide;
`git diff --check` clean). No existing file edited; `git add` the specific path only.

### Geometry verdict (the honest dichotomy)

**Q1 — is `MinorityAboveFloor` (live σ-minority at index `≥ l+1`) TRUE at the Phase-6 Post?**  **NO.**
`highMass l c = 0` reads (`phase6Post_iff`) as *every biased Main at index `≥ l`*, and a σ-minority Main
sitting EXACTLY at `l` satisfies `l ≤ l`. The Post does NOT forbid it. So `MinorityAboveFloor` is **not**
a static consequence of the landed Post.

**Q2 — does the eliminators-ABOVE re-orientation (Phase-8 `elimAbove`) dissolve the requirement?**
**NO — because Phase-7's binding consumer is gap-1-BELOW.** Surveyed both consumer defs:
- Phase-7 `elimGap1 σ i` = σ-opposite Mains at index `i`, paired `i+1 = j` ⟹ eliminators ONE INDEX
  BELOW the minority. This is the frozen `MarginLedgers.Phase6To7Structure` shape (carries the seed).
- Phase-8 `elimAbove σ i` = σ-opposite Mains at index `> i` ⟹ eliminators ABOVE. Genuinely floor-free
  (proved `elimAbove_floorFree`: under `AllBiasedMainAbove l`, every band member's index is `≥ l`
  automatically, no `l+1` seed needed).
So the orientation asymmetry is real, but the Phase-7 below-orientation BINDS — the re-cut does NOT
dissolve `MinorityAboveFloor`. Verdict: **`MinorityAboveFloor` is a genuine DYNAMIC floor invariant**,
seeded one notch above the Post and preserved by the frozen Phase-7 step.

### What is PROVED (the dynamic-invariant discharge)

- `AllBiasedMainAbove m c` — sign-agnostic threshold floor "every biased Main at index `≥ m`".
  `m = l` IS the Phase-6 Post (`allBiasedMainAbove_of_post`, def-unfolds `phase6Post_iff`).
- `cancelSplit_preserves_index_floor` — **the frozen-`cancelSplit` structural core**: for two Mains
  `s t` whose biased inputs are all at index `≥ m`, BOTH outputs of `cancelSplit L K s t` carry index
  `≥ m`. Exhaustive case split on ALL frozen branches (same-level → unbiased; gap-1/gap-1' → smaller
  index incremented UP, partner cancelled; gap-2/gap-2' → one index +1, other unchanged; same-sign /
  zero → returned). KEY FACT: **`cancelSplit` never LOWERS a biased index** — it only moves Mains UP
  (toward the floor) or cancels them. So the threshold floor is preserved for ANY `m`.
- `cancelStep_preserves_AllBiasedMainAbove` — the config-replacement lift: a `cancelSplit` of two
  Mains from a config satisfying `AllBiasedMainAbove m` keeps the floor on the two replaced agents
  (the untouched agents already satisfy it) — the deterministic atom for the trajectory lift.
- `minorityAboveFloor_of_allBiasedMainAbove` — the seed `AllBiasedMainAbove (l+1)` DISCHARGES
  `GapAlignment.MinorityAboveFloor σ l c` for BOTH signs simultaneously (sign-agnostic seed ⟹ both the
  σ-minority and the σ-opposite eliminators sit `≥ l+1`, exactly the honest geometry GapAlignment
  isolated).
- `elimAbove_floorFree` — the Phase-8 orientation is floor-free (the re-orientation verdict, formal).
- `minorityAboveFloor_both_of_seed` / `minorityAboveFloor_verdict` — CAPSTONE: the seed discharges
  `MinorityAboveFloor` for all signs AND the seed at `l+1` is `cancelSplit`-stable. Bundles the
  dischargeable content (1: seed ⟹ residual; 2: seed step-stable).

### Net for tip #2b

`MinorityAboveFloor` is **dissolved AS a standalone residual** and **reduced to one threshold seed**
`AllBiasedMainAbove (l+1)` at the Phase-6 Post boundary. The seed is (a) ONE notch above the landed
Post `highMass l = 0` (the honest carried gap = *the Phase-6 drain clears the floor index `l` itself
for the σ-minority before the partner band is read*), (b) PROVEN `cancelSplit`-stable through Phase 7
(no probability — pure index monotonicity of the frozen rule), (c) PROVEN to discharge
`MinorityAboveFloor` for both signs. The carried residual went from a per-sign per-level placement to a
single sign-agnostic threshold with proven step-stability; the only remaining brick is exporting the
`l+1` seed from the Phase-6 convergence proof (the drain's floor-index clearing), which is strictly the
same statement as the existing `highMass`-drain Post with the threshold bumped by one.

## tip #3 final — config-level `countP` delta for `hBand` (BandStepBookkeeping.lean, 2026-06-10)

**NEW file** `Probability/BandStepBookkeeping.lean` (append-only; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide;
all 8 headlines `#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; single-file `lake env lean`
green, 0 warnings). No existing file edited.

Discharges the deterministic core of `hBand` of `SpendLedgerLift.phase7Surviving_step_of_band` — the
config-level `Multiset.countP` aggregation of `SurvivalAccounting`'s PROVEN per-pair ledger.

**The countP identity chain (the genuine config aggregation):** for a both-Main applicable step,
`c' = c − {r₁,r₂} + {p₁,p₂}` with `{p₁,p₂} = cancelSplit r₁ r₂` (under `Phase7AllMain` ⟹
`Transition_eq_cancelSplit_of_phase7_main`). Writing `A i c := countP (elimAbovePred σ i) c`
(defeq the consumer `(elimAbove σ i).sum c.count` via `SpendLedgerLift.elimAbove_sum_eq_countP`):

    A i c' = A i (c − {r₁,r₂}) + countP_elim {p₁,p₂}          -- Multiset.countP_add
           = (A i c − countP_elim {r₁,r₂}) + countP_elim {p₁,p₂}  -- Multiset.countP_sub
    ⟹  A i c ≤ A i c' + countP(collidingMinority σ i){r₁,r₂}   -- per-pair ledger, both comps

i.e. the surviving above-`i` eliminator count drops by AT MOST the colliding σ-minority drained that
step. This is the honest `Δ(elimAbove) ≥ −Δ(minority)` bookkeeping.

**PROVED outright:**
- `cancelSplit_elimAbove_snd_survives_or_charged` — the `.2`-component per-pair ledger (mirror of
  `SurvivalAccounting.cancelSplit_elimAbove_survives_or_charged`, exhaustive frozen-`cancelSplit` cases
  on the second output). Needed because `{p₁,p₂}` is an unordered multiset — BOTH outputs must be bounded.
- `cancelSplit_elimAbove_pair_le` — the pair-level inequality (both ledgers, additive indicator form).
- `elimAbove_countP_drop_le_colliding` — the **config-level delta** (applicable both-Main step).
- `elimAbove_countP_step_drop_le_colliding` — the `stepDistOrSelf`-support form (`d = 0` on self /
  non-applicable; `d =` colliding `countP` on applicable both-Main).
- `survivalBand_step_closed_of_margin` — per-level conditional closure: a level with the per-step
  colliding margin (`E + d ≤ A i c`) keeps the floor.
- `survivalBandAbove_step_closed_of_marginBand` — the **`hBand`-shaped closure**: the margin band
  `SurvivalBandMargin σ E` (floor `+2`, the max single-step spend) is step-closed into the floor band
  `SurvivalBandAbove σ E`, conditional on minority-monotonicity `hLiveBack` (a level live at `c'` was
  live at `c`).

**THE HONEST RESIDUAL (what the fixed-`E` `hBand` still needs = residual #2's outputs):** the plain
fixed-constant band `SurvivalBandAbove σ E` is NOT pointwise step-closed — a single same-level cancel
spends one above-`i` eliminator (`d = 1`), so a level at the floor (`A i = E`) falls to `E − 1`. Two
deterministic inputs close it, both from residual #2 (NOT a new probability tail):
1. **Entry margin** — Phase-7 entry must carry `SurvivalBandMargin σ E` (floor `+2`, generally
   `Entry ≥ E + total spend`). This is the `GapAlignedElimFloor` routing (`BandRouting`/`GapAlignment`)
   + the sharpened Doty spend constant (`Spend = o(n)`, `SurvivalAccounting.survival_floor_honest`).
2. **Minority monotonicity** (`hLiveBack`) — the per-level minority count never rises under a Phase-7
   `cancelSplit` step (`Phase7Convergence.cancelSplit_minorityU_pair_le` / `minorityU_stepOrSelf_drop`),
   so a level live at `c'` was live at `c` — the landed minority-survival upper bound, per level.

With (1)+(2), `survivalBandAbove_step_closed_of_marginBand` supplies `hBand`,
`SpendLedgerLift.survivalBand_ae_along_trajectory` lifts it along the whole kernel trajectory, and
`SpendLedgerLift.phase7_to_phase8_via_canonicalSpend` closes the chain to
`EliminatorMargins.Phase7To8Structure` with NO remaining probability.

## SeedExport.lean — the `AllBiasedMainAbove (l+1)` seed exported (2026-06-10, EXIT_0, axiom-clean)

NEW append-only `Probability/SeedExport.lean` (single-file `lake env lean` EXIT_0; 13 headlines
`#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide;
`git diff --check` clean). Salvaged the predecessor's UNTRACKED draft VERBATIM — it compiled as-is;
all five referenced landed signatures (`Phase6Convergence.phase6Convergence'`,
`DrainThreading.phase6_hdrop_of_struct`, `DrainCalibration.phase6Convergence_calibrated`,
`BandRouting.phase6_to_phase7_of_post` / `.minorityConfinedGap1_of_post`,
`MinorityFloorGap.minorityAboveFloor_verdict`) were cross-checked against the actual files and matched
exactly, so no rewrite was needed.

**`l+1` CLOSED.** The Phase-6 drain is symbolic in the band level `l`, so instantiating at `l+1` is a
verbatim re-application — no new probability. The SOLE new content is the budget side-condition
`hlL2 : l + 2 ≤ L` (`succ_witnessHour_of_budget`): the `l+1` band-top index `l` needs a sampling hour
`l < h.val < L`, i.e. TWO free hours above the band floor (vs ONE for the bare-`l` Post). Exposed
explicitly, not hidden. Matches Doty §7 "one notch" separation, available while the clock has not
saturated top hour `L`.

**Surface delivered:** `phase6To7_surface_of_seed` / `phase6To7_surface_of_succ_post` — the strongest
reachable Phase6→7 form: `EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure σ E c` + `MinorityAboveFloor l τ c` for
EVERY sign + the `l+1`-floor `cancelSplit` step-stability, all from the single seed. The carried
`MinorityFloorGap` `MinorityAboveFloor` residual is now PRODUCED by the bumped drain, no longer assumed.

## BandEdges.lean — band UPPER edge + per-partner gap-1 placement (2026-06-10, EXIT_0, axiom-clean)

NEW append-only `Probability/BandEdges.lean` (module build EXIT_0; 10 headlines axiom-clean
`⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; 0 sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide; whitespace clean).

**Task 1 — band UPPER edge / honest band statement.** Surveyed what the landed Thm-6.2 confinement
pins: `MainExponentConfinement.MainProfileConfinedToUseful` (the `mainProfile_collapse` readout) is
`0.92·|M| ≤ #usefulMains`, the **CAP** `index < L`, NOT a 3-level band. The doubly-exponential descent
(`FrontTail.windowed_floor_crossing`) pins mass above the moving front; the landed certificate is the
cap with the front descended past it. So `BandRouting.MajoritySupportedOn`'s upper half is honestly
the **free cap `i ≤ L`** (every `Fin (L+1)`), giving the two-edge band `{l ≤ i ≤ L}`
(`majoritySupportedOn_twoEdge_of_post`), seed-sharpened to `{l+1 ≤ i ≤ L}`
(`majoritySupportedOn_twoEdge_of_seed`). The paper's 3-level band is carried as ONE named upper-edge
readout `MajorityTopEdge σ (l+2) c` (analogue of the cap-side `MainProfileConfinedToUseful`); given
it, `majoritySupportedOn_band3_of_post_topEdge` + `band3_card_le_three` + `exists_band3_level_floor_4n45`
recover the paper's `4n/45` pigeonhole.

**Task 2 — `GapAlignedElimFloor` per-partner placement.** Honest reduction (NOT pigeonhole alignment):
seed ⟹ `MinorityAboveFloor` (minority ≥ l+1); + carried `MinorityTopEdge σ (l+2) c` ⟹ minority ∈
`{l+1, l+2}` ⟹ predecessor set EXACTLY `{l, l+1}` (2 levels). The honest paper fact is **occupancy of
BOTH predecessor levels** (`TwoLevelOccupancy`: levels l, l+1 each ≥ E — the doubling chain passes
through EACH level). `gapAlignedElimFloor_of_twoLevel_occupancy` discharges `GapAlignedElimFloor` from
occupancy + floor + top. Arithmetic: 2-level set, budget 4n/15 ⟹ pigeonhole some level ≥ 2n/15;
occupancy of both at E ≤ 2n/15 ≤ 4n/15 (`twoLevel_constant_le_consumer`), tighter than 3-level 4n/45.

**Wired:** `phase6_to_phase7_of_seed_edges` / `phase6To7_surface_of_seed_edges` — from the single
`l+1` seed + `hA` + `h6` + carried `MinorityTopEdge` + `TwoLevelOccupancy`, the routing field
`GapAlignedElimFloor` is PRODUCED (not assumed) → `EliminatorMargins.Phase6To7Structure` (+
`MinorityAboveFloor` both signs + step-stability). Carried residual reduced to exactly the two
TOP-band readouts + `TwoLevelOccupancy`; every FLOOR half PROVEN from the landed drain.
