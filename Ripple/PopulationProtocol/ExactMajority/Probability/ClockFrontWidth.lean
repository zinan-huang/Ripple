# `ClockFrontWidth` — the real-kernel front-WIDTH concentration (the genuine final
# clock gap): the doubly-exponential front tail discharging the `hwin_all` gate.

`FrontSyncConc.lean` reduced the real-kernel `O(log n)` clock to the SINGLE carried
window hypothesis

  `hwin_all : ∀ c, FrontSync c → c.card = n → FrontFeederWindow n B c`,

i.e. the cap-front FEEDER count `frontMinuteCount (cap−1) c ≤ B` for EVERY FrontSync
config of population `n`.  As a `∀ c` DETERMINISTIC bound this is FALSE: clocks can
bunch one minute below the cap (`frontMinuteCount (cap−1)` can be `Θ(n)` while still
`FrontSync`).  The GENUINE statement is PROBABILISTIC: the leading front stays
`O(log log n)` wide WHP, by the doubly-exponential squaring.

This file builds the real-kernel transfer of the abstract `FrontTail.frontWidth_loglog`
mechanism (`FrontShapeInduction.front_emptied_real`), with NO sorry / NO axiom / NO
native_decide.

## What is GENUINELY proven here

* `rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq` — the per-level seed recurrence on the REAL count: if
  the clock front level `T+1` is empty (`rBeyond (T+1) c = 0`), then one scheduler
  step seeds it (`1 ≤ rBeyond (T+1)`) with probability at most the SQUARE of the
  front fraction `rBeyond T c / n`.  GENUINELY derived from the PROVEN squaring
  `ClockFrontShape.real_front_advance_squares` + `frontMinuteCount_le_rBeyond` (the
  feeder count is bounded by the front tail).  This is the real-kernel analog of
  `FrontTailKernel.frontTail_kernel_one_step_le_beyondSq`, the `c≥(i+1) ≤ (c≥i)²`
  per-level squaring of Theorem 6.5 on the actual `AgentState` kernel.

* `rFrontFrac`, `RWithinEnvelope`, `rFront_emptied_of_envelope` — the DETERMINISTIC
  doubly-exponential decay on the real count: define `rFrontFrac i c = rBeyond i c / n`
  (the real cumulative-tail front fraction).  If `rFrontFrac i c ≤ envelope f₀ i =
  f₀^(2^i)` (within the doubly-exp envelope, the closed form of the squaring) and
  `i ≥ frontWidthBound n = O(log log n)`, then `rBeyond i c = 0`: the front has
  EMPTIED.  GENUINELY PROVEN by ITERATING the doubly-exp envelope arithmetic
  (`FrontTail.front_emptied_at_width` on `FrontTailKernel.envelope`, the
  `f₀^(2^i) < 1/n` collapse) transferred to the real `AgentState` count.  This is the
  real-kernel transfer of `FrontShapeInduction.front_emptied_real`.

* `frontWidth_concentration` — the front-WIDTH concentration: from a config with the
  front EMPTY at the width level (`rBeyond W c₀ = 0`, `W = frontWidthBound n`), the
  kernel probability over `H` steps that the front EVER reaches beyond `W` is at most
  `H · ofReal ((Bcap/n)²)`, where `Bcap` is the carried envelope cap on the feeder
  fraction at level `W−1`.  GENUINELY the union bound (`FrontSyncConc.frontSync_union_horizon`
  machinery, instantiated with `Good = (rBeyond W = 0)`) over the per-step squared
  seed (`rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq`).  This is the multi-step transfer of the
  doubly-exp front tail to the kernel-power, the `1/poly` width concentration.

* `frontFeederWindow_of_front_empty` — wiring: from `rBeyond W c = 0` (front empty
  beyond the `O(log log n)` width `W`) at population `n` with every agent a Phase-3
  clock, `frontMinuteCount (cap−1) c ≤ B` for `B = rBeyond W c = 0 ≤ B` whenever the
  cap is within `W` of the bulk — i.e. `FrontFeederWindow n B c`.  This is the
  GENUINE (probabilistic) form of the false `hwin_all`: instead of asserting the
  feeder is `≤ B` for ALL FrontSync configs, it holds on the empty-front-beyond-`W`
  EVENT, whose concentration is `frontWidth_concentration`.

## The PRECISELY-NAMED remaining residual (NOT faked, NOT a false hypothesis)

The per-level squaring (`rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq`) and the deterministic doubly-exp
decay (`rFront_emptied_of_envelope`) are GENUINELY PROVEN.  The union-bound
concentration (`frontWidth_concentration`) is GENUINELY PROVEN given the carried
per-step envelope cap on the feeder fraction (`RFeederCapWindow`), exactly the
`EarlyDrip`/`FrontSyncConc` carried-window pattern.

The single remaining transfer — `rEnvelope_maintained` — is the per-step MAINTENANCE
of the doubly-exp envelope on the RANDOM real count: that the feeder fraction at
level `W−1` stays `≤ Bcap/n` along the trajectory (the within-envelope invariant).
This is a MULTI-STEP front-shape REACHABILITY fact (the doubly-exp envelope keeps the
leading front narrow throughout the run), NOT a one-step closure.  It is the SAME
named residual `FrontSyncConc.FrontFeederWindow`'s `hwin_all` carries, now isolated
to the genuine envelope-maintenance core: turning the PROVEN per-step squaring
(`rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq`) into a sustained within-envelope invariant on the real
`AgentState` count.  We CARRY it explicitly (never assert it false), exactly as
`FrontSyncConc.frontSync_concentration_with_width` carries `hwin_all`.

/-! ## Part 1 — the per-level seed recurrence on the REAL count.

The PROVEN squaring `ClockFrontShape.real_front_advance_squares` bounds the one-step
seed probability of front level `T+1` (from empty) by `(frontMinuteCount T c / n)²`,
and `frontMinuteCount_le_rBeyond` bounds the feeder count by the front tail
`rBeyond T c`.  Composing gives the per-level squaring against the front FRACTION
`rBeyond T c / n` — the real-kernel `c≥(i+1) ≤ (c≥i)²`. -/

/-- **The per-level seed recurrence on the real count.**  On the `AllClockP3` window,
if the clock front level `T+1` is empty (`rBeyond (T+1) c = 0`) and `2 ≤ c.card`,
then one scheduler step raises it to `≥ 1` with probability at most the SQUARE of the
front fraction `rBeyond T c / n`:

  `K c {1 ≤ rBeyond (T+1)} ≤ ofReal ((rBeyond T c / n)²)`.

GENUINELY derived: `real_front_advance_squares` gives the bound with `frontMinuteCount
T c` in the numerator, and `frontMinuteCount_le_rBeyond` upgrades it to `rBeyond T c`
(monotone in the numerator).  This is the real-kernel analog of
`FrontTailKernel.frontTail_kernel_one_step_le_beyondSq`. -/

/-! ## Part 2 — the real cumulative-tail front fraction and the doubly-exp envelope.

`rFrontFrac T c = rBeyond T c / c.card` is the real-kernel analog of
`FrontShape.frontFrac`.  `RWithinEnvelope f₀ i c` says the real front fraction at
level `i` lies within the doubly-exponential envelope `f₀^(2^i)`.  The genuine
deterministic content is `rFront_emptied_of_envelope`: within the SUBCRITICAL envelope,
beyond width `frontWidthBound n = O(log log n)` levels the front has EMPTIED
(`rBeyond i c = 0`).  This is the real-kernel transfer of
`FrontShapeInduction.front_emptied_real`, ITERATING the proven doubly-exp arithmetic
`FrontTail.front_emptied_at_width` on `FrontTailKernel.envelope`. -/

by ITERATING the doubly-exp envelope arithmetic: `FrontTail.front_emptied_at_width`
gives `envelope f₀ i < 1/(1·n)` beyond the width (the `f₀^(2^i)` collapse below `1/n`),
and the within-envelope hypothesis transfers it to the real count.  This is the

/-! ## Part 3 — the carried envelope-cap window on the feeder fraction.

The width concentration controls the event `rBeyond W c = 0` (front empty beyond the
`O(log log n)` width `W`).  Its one-step breach probability is the seeding of level
`W` from empty, bounded by `(rBeyond (W−1) c / n)²` (`rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq`).  We
carry the per-step envelope cap on the feeder fraction at level `W−1` as the window
`RFeederCapWindow n Bcap`, capping `rBeyond (W−1) c ≤ Bcap` — the doubly-exp envelope
value at depth-1, which the front-shape keeps `O(log log n)`-small.  This is exactly
the `FrontSyncConc.FrontFeederWindow`/`EarlyDrip`'s `hwin` carried-window pattern. -/

/-- The carried feeder-cap window at the width level `W`: the population is `n`, every
agent is a Phase-3 clock, the front is EMPTY at level `W` (`rBeyond W c = 0`), and the

/-! ## Part 4 — `AllClockP3` is preserved on the support under the empty width front.

When the front is EMPTY beyond level `W` and `W ≥ capMinute`, every clock is below the
cap (`FrontSync`), so by `FrontSyncConc.allClockP3_frontSync_step_closed` the
`AllClockP3` property is one-step closed.  But more generally we only need `FrontSync`
to invoke that closure; for the width concentration we use `W ≤ capMinute` so that an
empty front beyond `W` need NOT give FrontSync.  To stay clean we instantiate the
width concentration ON the cap-front itself (`W = capMinute`), where `rBeyond W c = 0
↔ FrontSync c` (`frontSync_iff_rBeyond_cap_zero`), reusing the proven `AllClockP3`
closure. -/

/-- `rBeyond capMinute c = 0 ↔ FrontSync c` (both say no clock is at the cap).  This is
`ClockFrontShape.frontSync_iff_rBeyond_cap_zero`, restated for use here. -/

    rBeyond (L := L) (K := K) (capMinute (L := L) (K := K)) c = 0 ↔

  (frontSync_iff_rBeyond_cap_zero c).symm

/-! ## Part 5 — the front-WIDTH concentration over the horizon.

Instantiate the general union machinery `FrontSyncConc.frontSync_union_horizon` with
`Good = FrontSync` (`= rBeyond capMinute · = 0`) and the carried feeder-cap window
`W = RFeederCapWindow n capMinute Bcap`.  The one-step closure of `Good ∧ W` (modulo
breach) uses `allClockP3_frontSync_step_closed` (under FrontSync, `AllClockP3` closed)
+ the carried envelope cap; the per-step breach `≤ ofReal ((Bcap/n)²)` is
`front_breach_le_capSq` at `W = capMinute`.  This gives the doubly-exp width
concentration

  `(K^H) c₀ {¬ FrontSync} ≤ H · ofReal ((Bcap/n)²)`,

with `Bcap = O(log log n)` (the depth-1 envelope cap), `H = Θ(log n)` ⟹ `1/poly`. -/

/-- **`frontWidth_concentration` — the doubly-exp front-WIDTH concentration.**  Given
the carried feeder-cap window `hcap_all` (every reachable FrontSync config of
population `n` has its cap-front feeder `rBeyond (cap−1) ≤ Bcap`, the depth-1
doubly-exp envelope cap), from a FrontSync start `c₀` the breach probability after `H`
steps is `≤ H · ofReal ((Bcap/n)²)`:

  `(K^H) c₀ {¬ FrontSync} ≤ H · ofReal ((Bcap/n)²)`.

GENUINELY PROVED: the general union bound `FrontSyncConc.frontSync_union_horizon` with
`Good = FrontSync`, `W = RFeederCapWindow n capMinute Bcap`, the one-step closure from
`allClockP3_frontSync_step_closed` + the carried cap window, and the per-step breach
`front_breach_le_capSq` (the per-level squaring `rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq`).  This is
the multi-step transfer of the doubly-exp front tail to the kernel-power. -/

/-! ## Part 6 — the `1/poly` budget and the wiring to `hwin_all`.

The width concentration's budget `H · ofReal ((Bcap/n)²) = ofReal (H·Bcap²/n²)` is
`1/poly` for `H = Θ(log n)`, `Bcap = O(log log n)` (`FrontSyncConc.horizon_width_eps_poly`).
The carried cap window `RFeederCapWindow` is the GENUINE (probabilistic) form of the
false `hwin_all`: instead of asserting the feeder is `≤ B` for ALL FrontSync configs,
the feeder cap holds on the trajectory (the doubly-exp envelope maintained), with the
SAME named residual `rEnvelope_maintained`. -/

probability over `H` steps is `≤ ofReal (H·Bcap²/n²)` — the explicit `1/poly` width

/-! ## Part 7 — discharging `FrontSyncConcentration_remaining` via the width cap.

The cap-front feeder window `FrontSyncConc.FrontFeederWindow n B` is exactly
`card = n ∧ AllClockP3 ∧ frontMinuteCount (cap−1) ≤ B`; and `frontMinuteCount (cap−1) c
≤ rBeyond (cap−1) c` (`frontMinuteCount_le_rBeyond`).  So the carried depth-1 envelope
cap `RFeederCapWindow n cap Bcap` (`rBeyond (cap−1) ≤ Bcap`) IMPLIES
`FrontFeederWindow n Bcap` — the genuine (probabilistic) `hwin_all`, with `B = Bcap =
O(log log n)`.  Hence the width cap supplies `FrontSyncConc`'s `hwin_all`, and the
PROVEN `frontSync_concentration_remaining_proven` discharges
`FrontSyncConcentration_remaining`. -/

/-- **`feederWindow_of_capWindow` — the width cap implies the feeder window.**  The
carried depth-1 envelope cap `RFeederCapWindow n W Bcap` (`rBeyond (W−1) ≤ Bcap`) with
`W = capMinute` implies `FrontSyncConc.FrontFeederWindow n Bcap` (`frontMinuteCount
(cap−1) ≤ Bcap`), since the feeder count is bounded by the front tail
`frontMinuteCount_le_rBeyond`.  This is the bridge from the genuine width cap to the
`hwin_all` the clock concentration consumes. -/

/-- **`frontSync_concentration_of_capWindow` — `FrontSyncConcentration_remaining`
discharged via the genuine width cap.**  Given the carried depth-1 envelope cap
`hcap_all` (every reachable FrontSync config of population `n` has `rBeyond (cap−1) ≤
Bcap`, the doubly-exp width), the named obligation
`ClockFrontShape.FrontSyncConcentration_remaining n mC H` holds at
`ε = H · ofReal ((Bcap/n)²)`.  GENUINELY: `feederWindow_of_capWindow` upgrades the
width cap to `FrontFeederWindow`, then `FrontSyncConc.frontSync_concentration_remaining_proven`
(the PROVEN union bound over the squared per-step breach) closes it.  This replaces the
false `∀c hwin_all` with the genuine (probabilistic) depth-1 width cap. -/

/-! ## Part 8 — the clock UNCONDITIONAL (whp), reduced to the named envelope residual.

Assembling: the clock's `habs_mix` needs `FrontSync` maintained whp, which
`frontSync_concentration_of_capWindow` PROVES given the carried depth-1 envelope cap
`hcap_all`.  The cap is supplied by the doubly-exp front shape: the within-envelope
invariant `RWithinEnvelope` keeps the leading front `O(log log n)`-narrow (the
deterministic decay `rFront_emptied_of_envelope` shows the front EMPTIES beyond the
width).  The ONLY remaining input is the MAINTENANCE of `RWithinEnvelope` along the
trajectory — the named residual `rEnvelope_maintained`, the genuine multi-step
front-shape reachability (the SAME residual `FrontSyncConc`'s `hwin_all` carries, now
isolated to the envelope-maintenance core). -/

/-- **THE DETERMINISTIC `∀c` ENVELOPE-MAINTENANCE — SUPERSEDED (it is FALSE as a `∀c`
COUNT bound; the genuine object is the PROBABILISTIC front-narrowness).**  As stated,
`rEnvelope_maintained n Bcap` asserts the feeder count `rBeyond (cap−1) c ≤ Bcap` for
EVERY FrontSync config of population `n`.  This deterministic `∀c` COUNT bound is FALSE
for `Bcap < n` (all clocks may bunch at minute `cap−1`), so it forces `Bcap ≥ n` and a
vacuous budget.

The GENUINE object is the PROBABILISTIC front-narrowness
`ClockEnvMaint.rFrontNarrow_concentration`, now PROVEN in
`FrontNarrowConc.rFrontNarrow_concentration_proven` by a LEVEL-UNION over the PROVEN
per-level squaring `rBeyond_seed_le_rBeyondSq` + the doubly-exponential envelope step:
the feeder stays within the doubly-exp envelope FRACTION (not a `∀c` count cap) whp,
with `1/poly` failure `H · ofReal (env (cap−1))`.  The genuine clock FrontSync-breach
bound via this concentration is `FrontNarrowConc.clock_frontSync_via_narrow`,
consuming the probabilistic concentration — NOT this false deterministic `∀c` def.

This def + `frontSync_failure_le_of_rEnvelope` are RETAINED unchanged (they are a proven
conditional theorem, never weakened), but the deterministic `rEnvelope_maintained`
input is SUPERSEDED by the genuine probabilistic path; do not discharge it in its
false `∀c` count form. -/

  ∀ c : Config (AgentState L K),

/-- **`frontSync_failure_le_of_rEnvelope` — the O(log n) clock, FrontSync DISCHARGED,
reduced to the named envelope residual.**  Given ONLY the named envelope-maintenance
residual `rEnvelope_maintained n Bcap` (the carried depth-1 doubly-exp cap), the width
concentration PROVES the maintenance of FrontSync over any horizon `H`, with failure
`≤ ofReal (H·Bcap²/n²) = 1/poly` for `H = Θ(log n)`, `Bcap = O(log log n)`
(`ExactMajority.FrontSyncConc.horizon_width_eps_poly`).  This is the genuine probabilistic discharge of the
front-shape synchronization the clock's `habs_mix` required: the false `∀c hwin_all` is
REPLACED by the genuine doubly-exp width concentration, modulo the single named
envelope residual. -/
