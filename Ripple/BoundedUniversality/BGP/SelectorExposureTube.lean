Ripple.BoundedUniversality.BGP.SelectorExposureTube
-------------------------------
The FAITHFUL local-view tube invariant for the clock-driven selector — the EXPOSURE-WEIGHTED norm,
the §3.3-correct replacement for the (non-inductive) naive `lv_j ≤ ρ` and the (false) divergent
depth-budget.

The §3.3 audit (3 engines + source) established: the stack branch maps push `X' = (c+X)/B` (slope 1/B,
height +1), pop `X' = B·X − c` (slope B, height −1), hold (slope 1) are NOT non-expansive in the raw
absolute error (a pop multiplies it by B), but ARE non-expansive in the EXPOSURE-WEIGHTED norm

  `E_j := B^(H_j + 2) · e_j`        (H_j = stack height, e_j = |ũ_j − X_j| the stack-code error).

Push burial (÷B with H+1) and pop exposure (×B with H−1) INVERSE-CANCEL against the height factor:
the exposure cost of an error injected at cycle ℓ is `B^(H_ℓ)` (the symbols above it), NOT `B^(j−ℓ)`
(the future time gap, which the divergent depth-budget wrongly used).  With double-exponentially small
write/gate defects `ξ_ℓ`, the weighted reserve `Σ B^(H+2)·ξ` is finite, so `E_j ≤ ρ` all-cycle ⟹ the
top+second reads stay inside the gate margin all-cycle (`B^2·e_j ≤ E_j ≤ ρ`).  This is the genuine
local-view tube, locally faithful per fixed input.

/-- **Exposure-weighted NON-EXPANSIVENESS** (burial/exposure inverse-cancellation).  From the per-cycle
branch recurrence `e(j+1) ≤ B^(H_j − H_{j+1}) · e_j + ξ_j` (the branch slope is `B^(height decrease)`:
pop `+1`, push `−1`, hold `0`), the exposure-weighted error only accumulates the weighted forcing:

  `E_{j+1} ≤ E_j + B^(H_{j+1}+2) · ξ_j`.

The `B`-amplification of a pop is exactly absorbed by the height-factor drop — it is NOT multiplied by
`B` forever after, unlike the divergent depth-budget. -/

`Ω_ℓ ≤ C·r^ℓ` with `0 ≤ r < 1`, then the running reserve `E_0 + Σ_{ℓ<j} Ω_ℓ` is uniformly bounded by
`E_0 + C/(1−r)`.  Double-exponential write/gate defects give a super-geometric `Ω`, a fortiori this
geometric bound — so the reserve is finite for each fixed input. -/
